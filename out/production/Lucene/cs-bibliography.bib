  abstract = {The number of undergraduates entering computer science has declined in recent years. This is paralleled by a drop in the number of high school students taking the CS AP exam and the number of high schools offering computer science courses. The declines come at a time when career opportunities in CS continue to grow and computer science graduates are seen as crucial in building a globally competitive workforce for the 21st century. Efforts aimed at reversing the declining interest in computer science include curriculum revisions at the undergraduate level at many institutions, a re-design of computer science AP courses [1], and the inclusion of computational thinking into disciplines outside computer science [3]. This panel discusses four projects of computer science researchers collaborating with high school teachers on integrating computing and computational thinking into their courses. The majority of the high school teachers involved is teaching science and math courses. They are teaching a diverse group of talented and college-bound students. The goal of all projects is to integrate computing into disciplines represented in the high school curriculum and to raise the awareness of computer science as an exciting and intellectually rewarding field. This panel will outline recent and on-going activities and interaction with high school teachers. Each panelist will describe how he/she got involved and the nature of the interaction. The panelists will talk about their individual projects, outline their visions for future interactions, and how their effort can be replicated by others. The session will briefly describe NSF's RET program which provided teacher support for three of the four projects. The session will then be opened for discussion; the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and contribute additional ideas for the inclusion of computational thinking in high school courses.},

It draws concepts and techniques such as abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, evaluation and iteration from computer and information science, but has broad application in the arts, sciences, humanities and social sciences. This paper compares computational and critical modes of thinking, identifying concepts and terminology that support cross-disciplinary discourse, inform faculty and curriculum development efforts, and interconnect learning outcomes at the course, program and university level, thus helping programs better articulate contributions to institutional goals.

@inproceedings{syslo2015algorithmic,
  abstract = {Computational thinking, as coined by Jeannette Wing, is a fundamental skill for all to be able to live in today's world, a mode of thought that goes well beyond computing and provides a framework for reasoning about problems and methods of their solution. It has a long tradition as algorithmic thinking which within computer science is a competence to formulate a solution of a problem in the form of an algorithm and then to implement the algorithm as a computer program. Computational thinking is not an adequate characterization of computer science as claimed by Peter Denning and he is right -- it is a collection of key mental tools and practices originated in computing but addressed to all areas far beyond computer science. As an extension of algorithmic thinking, it includes thinking with many levels of abstraction as a problem solving approach inherently connected to computer science and addressed to all students to use computers and computing skills in solving problems in various school subjects coming from various scientific and applied areas. Computational thinking involves concepts, skills and competences that lie at the heart of computing, such as abstraction, decomposition, generalization, approximation, heuristics, algorithm design, efficiency and complexity issues and therefore it is clear that basic computer science knowledge helps to systematically, correctly, and efficiently process information, perform tasks, and solve problems. Although coming from computer science, computational thinking is not only the study of computer science, though computers play an essential role in the design of problems' solutions. It is a very important and useful mode of thinking in almost all disciplines and school subjects as an insight into what can and cannot be computed. In this talk we shall discuss a new computing curriculum addressed to ALL students in K-12 in Poland which motivates them to use computational thinking in solving problems in various school subjects. Moreover its goal is to encourage and prepare students from early school years to consider computing and related fields as disciplines of their future study and professional career. To this end, the curriculum allows teachers and schools to personalize learning and teaching according to students' interests, abilities, and needs. The new computing curriculum benefits a lot from our experience in teaching informatics in our schools for almost 30 years -- the first curriculum was approved by the ministry of education in 1985, 20 years after the first regular classes on informatics were held in two high schools in Wroc≈Çaw and in Warsaw. Today, informatics is an obligatory subject in middle school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12) and it will replace computer lessons (mainly on ICT) in elementary schools (grades 1-6). The new curriculum is also addressed to vocational education.},

@article{turpen2016perceived,
  abstract = { In order to promote sustained and impactful educational transformation, it is essential for change agents to understand more about faculty perceptions associated with either adopting or not adopting a research-based instructional strategy (RBIS). In this paper, we use interviews with 35 physics faculty to examine barriers and affordances to the use of the research-based instructional strategy of Peer Instruction. We found that the most common reasons faculty give for aligning their instruction with Peer Instruction is that it is not lecture and they have had positive experiences with Peer Instruction. The most common reasons faculty give for not using Peer Instruction are concerns about the time it will take, the loss of content coverage, and having had bad experiences with it. Additionally, we found the perceived barriers to be very different depending on whether the interviewee was a user of Peer Instruction or not, with nonusers being more concerned with time and users being more concerned with implementation difficulties. It is important for change agents to understand and address concerns faculty have about implementing researchbased instructional strategies. Based on these results we offer four recommendations for those interested in promoting educational transformation toward research-based instructional strategies: (1) do not waste a lot of time criticizing lecture-based instruction and convincing faculty of the value of research-based strategies (they are already dissatisfied with lecture), (2) understand and address concerns faculty have about implementing active learning techniques, (3) focus on supporting and encouraging faculty experiences with RBIS, (4) address concerns faculty new to RBIS have about the time and energy needed to change.},

@inproceedings{lu2009thinking,
  abstract = {Jeannette Wing's call for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) as a formative skill on par with reading, writing, and arithmetic places computer science in the category of basic knowledge. Just as proficiency in basic language arts helps us to effectively communicate and in basic math helps us to successfully quantitate, proficiency in computational thinking helps us to systematically and efficiently process information and tasks. But while teaching everyone to think computationally is a noble goal, there are pedagogical challenges. Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming, and whether we can separate it from teaching basic computer science. How much programming, if any, should be required for CT proficiency?

We believe that to successfully broaden participation in computer science, efforts must be made to lay the foundations of CT long before students experience their first programming language. We posit that programming is to Computer Science what proof construction is to mathematics, and what literary analysis is to English. Hence by analogy, programming should be the entrance into higher CS, and not the student's first encounter in CS. We argue that in the absence of programming, teaching CT should focus on establishing vocabularies and symbols that can be used to annotate and describe computation and abstraction, suggest information and execution, and provide notation around which mental models of processes can be built. Lastly, we conjecture that students with sustained exposure to CT in their formative education will be better prepared for programming and the CS curriculum, and, furthermore, that they might choose to major in CS not only for career opportunities, but also for its intellectual content.},

Today's designers need a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography.

After an introduction to cryptography and data security, the authors explain the main techniques in modern cryptography, with chapters addressing stream ciphers, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and 3DES, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), block ciphers, the RSA cryptosystem, public-key cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem, elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), digital signatures, hash functions, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and methods for key establishment, including certificates and public-key infrastructure (PKI). Throughout the book, the authors focus on communicating the essentials and keeping the mathematics to a minimum, and they move quickly from explaining the foundations to describing practical implementations, including recent topics such as lightweight ciphers for RFIDs and mobile devices, and current key-length recommendations.

The authors have considerable experience teaching applied cryptography to engineering and computer science students and to professionals, and they make extensive use of examples, problems, and chapter reviews, while the book‚Äôs website offers slides, projects and links to further resources. This is a suitable textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses and also for self-study by engineers.},

@article{talia2013workflow,
  abstract = {The wide availability of high-performance computing systems, Grids and Clouds, allowed scientists and engineers to implement more and more complex applications to access and process large data repositories and run scientific experiments in silico on distributed computing platforms. Most of these applications are designed as workflows that include data analysis, scientific computation methods, and complex simulation techniques. Scientific applications require tools and high-level mechanisms for designing and executing complex workflows. For this reason, in the past years, many efforts have been devoted towards the development of distributed workflow management systems for scientific applications. This paper discusses basic concepts of scientific workflows and presents workflow system tools and frameworks used today for the implementation of application in science and engineering on high-performance computers and distributed systems. In particular, the paper reports on a selection of workflow systems largely used for solving scientific problems and discusses some open issues and research challenges in the area.},

A common instructor concern is that students will respond negatively. This study measures the relationship between student response to instruction and 1) students' expectations for types of instruction, 2) students‚Äô experiences of different types of instruction, and 3) instructor strategies for using in-class activities. Student Response to Instructional Practices (StRIP) survey data from 179 students at three U.S. institutions were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression modeling. Significant predictors in the final models of student response were student expectations of active learning lecture and passive lecture, experiences of group based activities, and instructor strategies for explaining and facilitating active learning. These empirical results support recommendations in prior literature about best practices for reducing student resistance and demonstrate that instructors have great power to influence student reactions to active learning and ultimately reduce student resistance. There was no evidence in this data set to support the common concern that instructor or course evaluations are negatively affected by adopting active learning strategies.},

@article{khatri2016designing,
  abstract = {The physics education research community has produced a wealth of knowledge about effective teaching and learning of college level physics. Based on this knowledge, many research-proven instructional strategies and teaching materials have been developed and are currently available to instructors. Unfortunately, these intensive research and development activities have failed to influence the teaching practices of many physics instructors. This paper describes interim results of a larger study to develop a model of designing materials for successful propagation. The larger study includes three phases, the first two of which are reported here. The goal of the first phase was to characterize typical propagation practices of education developers, using data from a survey of 1284 National Science Foundation (NSF) principal investigators and focus group data from eight disciplinary groups of NSF program directors. The goal of the second phase was to develop an understanding of successful practice by studying three instructional strategies that have been well propagated. The result of the first two phases is a tentative model of designing for successful propagation, which will be further validated in the third phase through purposeful sampling of additional well-propagated instructional strategies along with typical education development projects. We found that interaction with potential adopters was one of the key missing ingredients in typical education development activities. Education developers often develop a polished product before getting feedback, rely on mass-market communication channels for dissemination, and do not plan for supporting adopters during implementation. The tentative model resulting from this study identifies three key propagation activities: interactive development, interactive dissemination, and support of adopters. Interactive development uses significant feedback from potential adopters to develop a strong product suitable for use in many settings. Interactive dissemination uses personal interactions to reach and motivate potential users. Support of adopters is missing from typical propagation practice and is important to reduce the burden of implementation and increases the likelihood of successful adoption.},

  abstract = {Seemingly similar individuals often experience drastically different success trajectories, with some repeatedly failing and others consistently succeeding. One explanation is preexisting variability along unobserved fitness dimensions that is revealed gradually through differential achievement. Alternatively, positive feedback operating on arbitrary initial advantages may increasingly set apart winners from losers, producing runaway inequality. To identify social feedback in human reward systems, we conducted randomized experiments by intervening in live social environments across the domains of funding, status, endorsement, and reputation. In each system we consistently found that early success bestowed upon arbitrarily selected recipients produced significant improvements in subsequent rates of success compared with the control group of nonrecipients. However, success exhibited decreasing marginal returns, with larger initial advantages failing to produce much further differentiation. These findings suggest a lesser degree of vulnerability of reward systems to incidental or fabricated advantages and a more modest role for cumulative advantage in the explanation of social inequality than previously thought},

In the context of an interview study of a randomized, stratified sample of SFES from across the United States, we discovered that most SFES interviewed (82%) perceived having professional impacts in the realm of improving undergraduate science education, more so than in research in science education or K-12 science education. While SFES reported a rich variety of efforts towards improving undergraduate science education, the most prevalent reported impact by far was influencing the teaching practices of their departmental colleagues.

@article{besterfieldsacre2014changing,
  abstract = {Background
Many reports present a vision of what engineering education should look like, but few describe how this should happen. An American Society for Engineering Education initiative in 2006 attempted to bridge this gap by engaging faculty, chairs, and deans in discussion of change in engineering education; results were reported in a Phase I report (2009). In a second phase, survey data were integrated into a Phase II report (2012).

Purpose
This article uses the ASEE survey results to identify promising pathways for transforming engineering undergraduate education.

Design/Method
The survey asked faculty, chairs, and deans at engineering departments at 156 U.S. institutions to reflect on the recommendations of the Phase I report. Quantitative and qualitative responses were separately analyzed and then mixed by mapping findings to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson et al. (2011), which frames the results and illustrates gaps and opportunities.

Results
Responses mapped to three of the four categories of the model that were most commonly used in other STEM education efforts: developing and disseminating new instructional approaches, supporting faculty members in their own scholarly teaching, and implementing policies that enable and reward teaching innovation. No responses mapped to developing a shared vision through activities such as strategic planning.

Conclusions
The greatest promise for transformative change in engineering education lies in developing a shared vision for educational innovation. The findings of this article provide a foundation for ongoing discussion and evaluating progress.

Drawing on years of experience helping large organizations adopt DITA, the authors answer crucial questions the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù DITA documents ignore, including: Where do you start? What should you know up front? What are the pitfalls in implementing DITA? How can you avoid those pitfalls?

The authors begin with topic-based writing, presenting proven best practices for developing effective topics and short descriptions. Next, they address content architecture, including how best to set up and implement DITA maps, linking strategies, metadata, conditional processing, and content reuse. Finally, they offer ‚Äúin the trenches‚Äù solutions for ensuring quality implementations, including guidance on content conversion.

Coverage includes:
Knowing how and when to use each DITA element‚Äìand when not to
Writing ‚Äúminimalist,‚Äù task-oriented information that quickly meets users‚Äô needs
Creating effective task, concept, and reference topics for any product, technology, or service
Writing effective short descriptions that work well in all contexts

The emerging research tradition of STEM discipline-based education research (DBER) is introduced briefly, with a focus on physics education research (PER). Examples of cognitive science research that are beginning to affect classroom practice are introduced, as well as examples that have direct implications for improving STEM instructional practices, yet remain largely unknown in the STEM community. Two barriers slow the implementation of CS findings in undergraduate STEM instruction. The first is lack of communication between cognitive science and STEM DBER researchers. The second is that, even when strong curricula and instructional practices are developed, there are many structural obstacles that make it difficult for STEM instructors to implement new instructional strategies. We provide an overview of current efforts to overcome these structural obstacles, and suggest policy implications for the cognitive science and DBER research communities that could facilitate the development, evaluation, and adoption of research-based instructional strategies in STEM undergraduate education.},

  abstract = {Technologies of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have contributed significantly to the emergence of the Knowledge Society. However, there is a strong gender gap in the field of science and technology due to the influence of the male-centered culture that persists today. Computational thinking is presented as a way to develop in children from an early age the ability to solve problems, designing systems and understanding human behavior while using the fundamental concepts of computing. This factor allows girls to be in touch with technology in a fun and meaningful way; so as to balance the male and female presence in science and technology, achieving a more egalitarian system. In this article is presented a systematic review of the literature which indicates that few studies about computational thinking are working from a gender perspective, although some countries have already opted for teaching computer in the classroom. In addition, the review shows some methodologies which are using languages and suitable tools in order to work the computational thinking. Notwithstanding, It can be the basis for a proposal to integrate the gender perspective. In turn, it is committed to the creation of a methodological guide that encourages this teaching in national and international schools.},

In this paper, we describe the first phase of our research-the development and validation of a classroom observation protocol to assess student responses to instructors' use of active learning. This protocol, which draws upon other published observation protocols, allows researchers to capture data about instructors' use of and students' responses to active learning. We also present findings from four first and second year engineering courses at two institutions that demonstrate the variety of ways engineering students resist active learning and strategies that engineering instructors have employed to reduce student resistance.},

@book{grinstead1997introduction,
  abstract = {text is designed for an introductory probability course at the university level for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in mathematics, physical and social sciences, engineering, and computer science. It presents a thorough treatment of ideas and techniques necessary for a firm understanding of the subject. The text is also recommended for use in discrete probability courses. The material is organized so that the discrete and continuous probability discussions are presented in a separate, but parallel, manner. This organization does not emphasize an overly rigorous or formal view of probabililty and therefore offers some strong pedagogical value. Hence, the discrete discussions can sometimes serve to motivate the more abstract continuous probability discussions. Features: Key ideas are developed in a somewhat leisurely style, providing a variety of interesting applications to probability and showing some nonintuitive ideas. Over 600 exercises provide the opportunity for practicing skills and developing a sound understanding of ideas. Numerous historical comments deal with the development of discrete probability. The text includes many computer programs that illustrate the algorithms or the methods of computation for important problems.},

Subjects included 105 students enrolled in an introductory computer science course. The study revealed three predictive factors in the following order of importance: comfort level (with a positive influence), math background (with a positive influence), and attribution to luck (with a negative influence). No significant gender differences were found in these three factors. The study also revealed that both a formal class in programming (which had a positive correlation) and game playing (which had a negative correlation) were predictive of success.

Our analysis examines directed graphs in which nodes represent users‚Äô geographic locations and edges represent (a) follower relationships, (b) successive commits, or (c) contributions to the same project.

@book{tanimoto2012interdisciplinary,
  abstract = {This book explores image processing from several perspectives: the creative, the theoretical (mainly mathematical), and the programmatical. It explains the basic principles of image processing, drawing on key concepts and techniques from mathematics, psychology of perception, computer science, and art, and introduces computer programming as a way to get more control over image processing operations. It does so without requiring college-level mathematics or prior programming experience. The content is supported by PixelMath, a freely available software program that helps the reader understand images as both visual and mathematical objects. The first part of the book covers such topics as digital image representation, sampling, brightness and contrast, color models, geometric transformations, synthesizing images, stereograms, photomosaics, and fractals. The second part of the book introduces computer programming using an open-source version of the easy-to-learn Python language. It covers the basics of image analysis and pattern recognition, including edge detection, convolution, thresholding, contour representation, and K-nearest-neighbor classification. A chapter on computational photography explores such subjects as high-dynamic-range imaging, autofocusing, and methods for automatically inpainting to fill gaps or remove unwanted objects in a scene. Applications described include the design and implementation of an image-based game. The PixelMath software provides a "transparent" view of digital images by allowing the user to view the RGB values of pixels by zooming in on an image. PixelMath provides three interfaces: the pixel calculator; the formula page, and advanced extension of the calculator; and the Python window.},

@book{schneier2015applied,
  abstract = {From the world's most renowned security technologist, Bruce Schneier, this 20th Anniversary Edition is the most definitive reference on cryptography ever published and is the seminal work on cryptography. Cryptographic techniques have applications far beyond the obvious uses of encoding and decoding information. For developers who need to know about capabilities, such as digital signatures, that depend on cryptographic techniques, there's no better overview than Applied Cryptography, the definitive book on the subject. Bruce Schneier covers general classes of cryptographic protocols and then specific techniques, detailing the inner workings of real-world cryptographic algorithms including the Data Encryption Standard and RSA public-key cryptosystems. The book includes source-code listings and extensive advice on the practical aspects of cryptography implementation, such as the importance of generating truly random numbers and of keeping keys secure.

". . .the best introduction to cryptography I've ever seen. . . .The book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published. . . ." -Wired Magazine

". . .monumental . . . fascinating . . . comprehensive . . . the definitive work on cryptography for computer programmers . . ." -Dr. Dobb's Journal

". . .easily ranks as one of the most authoritative in its field." -PC Magazine

The book details how programmers and electronic communications professionals can use cryptography-the technique of enciphering and deciphering messages-to maintain the privacy of computer data. It describes dozens of cryptography algorithms, gives practical advice on how to implement them into cryptographic software, and shows how they can be used to solve security problems. The book shows programmers who design computer applications, networks, and storage systems how they can build security into their software and systems.

With a new Introduction by the author, this premium edition will be a keepsake for all those committed to computer and cyber security.},

@book{kramer2004trust,
  abstract = {The effective functioning of a democratic society - including social, business, and political interactions - largely depends on trust. Yet trust remains a fragile and elusive resource in many of the organizations that make up society's building blocks. In their timely volume, Trust and Distrust in Organizations, editors Roderick M. Kramer and Karen S. Cook have compiled the most important research on trust in organizations, illuminating the complex nature of how trust develops, functions, and often is thwarted in organizational settings. With contributions from social psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, economists, and organizational theorists, the volume examines trust and distrust within a variety of settings - from employer-employee and doctor-patient relationships, to geographically dispersed work teams and virtual teams on the Internet. "Trust and Distrust in Organizations opens with an in-depth examination of hierarchical relationships to determine how trust is established and maintained between people with unequal power. Kurt Dirks and Daniel Skarlicki find that trust between leaders and their followers is established when people perceive a shared background or identity and interact well with their leader. After trust is established, people are willing to assume greater risks and to work harder. In part II, the contributors focus on trust between people in teams and networks. Roxanne Zolin and Pamela Hinds discover that trust is more easily established in geographically dispersed teams when they are able to meet face-to-face initially. Trust and Distrust in Organizations moves on to an examination of how people create and foster trust and of the effects of power and betrayal on trust. Kimberly Elsbach reports that managers achieve trust by demonstrating concern, maintaining open communication, and behaving consistently. The final chapter by Roderick Kramer and Dana Gavrieli includes recently declassified data from secret conversations between President Lyndon Johnson and his advisors that provide a rich window into a leader's struggles with problems of trust and distrust in his administration. "Broad in scope, Trust and Distrust in Organizations provides a captivating and insightful look at trust, power, and betrayal, and is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the underpinnings of trust within a relationship or an organization.-- Publisher description.},

From this perspective it has the potential to be a comprehensive umbrella for capturing the intrinsic nature of computing and conveying this in an understandable way to students and the general public. It represents a broad spectrum of reasoning across time and disciplines. Learning to count is a beginning of human computational thinking, followed naturally by arithmetic computation and abstract levels of symbol based thinking, often starting with algebra. Counting, arithmetic, symbols and abstract thinking are fundamental to the study of computing. Computational reasoning is the core of all modern Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines and is intrinsic to all other disciplines from A to Z. It is used in our everyday lives from baking a cake, changing a tire or brushing our teeth. The human brain is wired to think computationally, as are modern computing devices. As educators, a Computational Thinking perspective can help us to convey fundamental computing ideas to all students. This special session will outline the principles of Computational Thinking, offer suggestions on ways to promote Computational Thinking at all educational levels, and provide ample time for audience participation and discussion.},

@article{deschryver2015creative,
  abstract = { For too long, creativity in schools has been almost solely associated with art, music, and writing classes. Now, creative thinking skills are increasingly emphasized across the disciplines. At the same time, technological progress has brought about calls for the integration of new literacies and computational thinking to prepare students as problem solvers and critical thinkers. However, in teaching and learning, all three perspectives most often manifest in isolation.  We believe this is to the detriment of both educators and students alike.

	In this paper, we develop an argument for the use of new literacies and computational thinking to promote creative thinking. First, we explore the various elements that comprise computational thinking, while demonstrating their overlap with the theoretical constructs of creative thinking. Second, we identify the design decisions that guided our plan for integrating all three perspectives in a sequence of educational technology courses designed for in-service teachers. Finally, we provide examples of the classroom activities that best facilitated creative thinking, and address how we achieved them.},

  abstract = {Despite numerous calls for the transformation of undergraduate STEM
education, there is still a lack of successful models for creating large-scale,
systemic cultural changes in STEM departments. To date, change efforts have
generally focused on one of three areas: developing reflective teachers,
disseminating curricula and pedagogy, or enacting institutional policy. These
efforts illustrate many of the challenges of departmental change; in
particular, they highlight the need for a holistic approach that integrates
across all three of these levels: individual faculty, whole departments, and
university policymakers. To address these challenges, as part of our
campus-wide AAU-sponsored effort in STEM education transformation, we import
and integrate models of change from multiple perspectives. We draw from models
in organizational change, from departmental and disciplinary change in STEM
education, and from efforts to support individual efforts such as the
development and dissemination model. As a result, our departmental cultural
change efforts are an attempt at holistic reform. We will discuss our
theoretical underpinnings and ground this theory in a sample of approaches in
two departments.},

Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.},

@article{borrego2014increasing,
  abstract = {Background
Prior efforts have built a knowledge base of effective undergraduate STEM pedagogies, yet rates of implementation remain low. Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature.

Purpose
This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers.

Scope/Method
This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research.

Conclusions
Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.

The career progression of many new graduates is severely impacted due to the lack of well rounded skills. For example, some of the technically stronger graduates lack communication and managerial skills and vise versa. Industry based capstone projects, incorporated as a part of an undergraduate degree, are a well accepted means of preparing students for their professional careers. Software Engineering undergraduates at the University of Melbourne engage in such industry based projects both in the penultimate and final years of their degree. Though aimed at providing students a real-life SE experience and preparing them for industry, we observed these projects to fail in some cases in giving the necessary breadth of skills. We believe this failure to be due to the lack of an objective framework to guide student learning outcomes during projects. To address this problem we developed an objective skill-based framework, focusing on managerial, engineering and personal skills. In this paper, we present this framework and share our experiences of using it.},

  abstract = {In the past ten years, engineering classrooms have seen an exponential growth in the use of technology, more than during any other previous decade. Unprecedented advancements, such as the advent of innovative gadgets and fundamental instructional alterations in engineering classrooms, have introduced changes in both teaching and learning. Student learning in introductory, fundamental engineering mechanics (IFEM) courses, such as statics of engineering, mechanics of materials, dynamics, and mechanics of fluids, as in any other class, is influenced by the experiences students go through in the classroom. Thus, bold new methodologies that connect science to life using student-centered approaches and scaffolding pedagogies need to be emphasized more in the learning process. This study is aimed to gain insight into the role of student-centered teaching, particularly the implementation of scaffolding pedagogies into IFEM courses. This study also attempts to contribute to the current national conversation in engineering education of the need to change its landscape‚Äîfrom passive learning to active learning. Demographic characteristics in this study included a total of 3,592 students, of whom 3,160 (88.0\%) are males and 432 (12.0\%) are females, over a period of six years, from 2007 to 2013. The students‚Äô majors included aerospace engineering, agricultural engineering, civil engineering, construction engineering, industrial engineering, materials engineering, and mechanical engineering.

Results of the study, as tested using a general linear univariate model analysis, indicated that overwhelmingly the type of class in statics of engineering is a significant predictor of student ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù performance in tests measuring their knowledge of mechanics of materials. There is a statistically significant difference in students'performance in mechanics of materials depending on whether they were taught passively using the teacher-centered pedagogy or taught actively using the student-centered pedagogy in statics of engineering. Mechanics of materials is commonly the next immediate course, or a downstream course, following statics of engineering.},

@phdthesis{xu2007mining,
  abstract = {The success of Open Source Software (OSS) has attracted increased interest in many research areas. Unlike proprietary closed software, OSS projects are developed in a distributed and decentralized way. The OSS community is largely composed of part-time developers. These developers have developed a substantial number of outstanding technical achievements. A research study on how OSS developers interact with each other and how projects are developed will help researchers understand the success and failure of OSS projects. OSS developers can also benefit from this research, by being able to make more informed decisions for participating on OSS projects.
In this dissertation, we address the challenge of efficiently mining data from OSS web repositories and building models to study OSS community features. Data collection for OSS study is nontrivial since most OSS projects are developed by distributed developers using web tools. Most previous studies focus on manually creating a web crawler to collect data from OSS web sites. This method is usually implemented by creating a web crawler based on specific research goals. We design a mining process which combines web mining and database mining together to identify, extract, filter and analyze data. We address and analyze the difficulty of mining OSS data. Our work provides a general solution for researchers to implement advanced techniques, such as web mining, data mining, statistics, and algorithms to collect and analyze web repository data.

Based on our mining results, we model the OSS community as a social network, one which can be further modeled as a project network and a developer network, and study properties of these networks. Our goal is to find intrinsic mechanisms that lie in OSS networks to explain some OSS specific features such as roles of developers, communication, and reliability of the OSS community. We construct four social networks for the OSS development community at SourceForge [59]. Each social network is created by expanding the number of people with different roles in the network, moving from the core project leaders, to the core developers, to the co-developers, and finally out to active users. Social network properties such as degree distribution, diameter, cluster size, and clustering coefficient are calculated and compared for each of the expanding social networks. We elaborate on how the changing topological characteristics of the social networks may signify important capabilities for the diffusion of information, the ability to find collaborations, and the overall robustness of the OSS development community. We further find that all the social networks have scale-free properties, and the inclusion of the co-developers and active users triggers the emergence of the small-world phenomenon for the social network. We examine how these topological network properties may potentially explain the success and efficiency of OSS development practices.

To study the organization and backbones of the OSS community, we conduct the identification of the community structure on the SourceForge project network. We find that groups exist in the SourceForge project network. Furthermore, we explore possible reasons for the formation of those groups by examining assortative mixing coefficients for projects categories. Among them, we find projects with same programming languages, operating systems and topics are more likely to be grouped together. Our research provides useful information to study the interaction between projects and the communication and information flow in OSS virtual organizations.

We simulate the OSS community based on four social network models: random graphs, preferential attachment, preferential attachment with constant fitness, and preferential attachment with dynamic fitness, using two tools‚ÄîRepast and Swarm. Our simulation models are fit to data from year two in the history of SourceForge. To prove the correctness of our simulations, dockingexperiments are performed on the Repast simulation and the Java/Swarm simulation. Our models simulate developers' actions and the growth of the OSS community. We compare properties of social networks such as degree distribution, diameter and clustering coefficient to dock Repast and Swarm simulations of four social network models. Our practice demonstrates the importance of verifications in scientific simulations. The simulation models we build can be used to forecast future development of OSS community.},

However, what computational thinking really means remains speculative.

It argues that computational thinking is likely a hybrid thinking paradigm that must accommodate different thinking modes in terms of the way each would influence what we do in computation. Furthermore, the article makes an attempt to define computational thinking and connect the (potential) thinking elements to the known thinking paradigms.

Social exchange theory is used as a framework for predicting three outcomes of Human Resource Management (HRM) practice: employee commitment, employee motivation and desire to remain with the organization. The statistical models were found to predict 58 percent of the variation in employee commitment, 53 percent variation in motivation and 41 percent of the variance in respondents' desire to remain with the organization. Consistent with social exchange theory, the results highlight the importance of trust in management, which was found to predict positively all three outcomes. Team-working was found to predict employee commitment and motivation, with employee involvement, empowerment, the offer of fair rewards and job security having significant effects on worker motivation. The implications of these findings for management practice and theory are discussed. },

  abstract = {The lack of knowledge about how to effectively spread and sustain the use of research-based instructional strategies is currently a significant barrier to the improvement of undergraduate physics education. In this paper we address this lack of knowledge by reporting on an interview study of 35 physics faculty, of varying institution types, who were self-reported users of, former users of, or knowledgeable nonusers of the research-based instructional strategy Peer Instruction. Interview questions included in this analysis focused on the faculty‚Äôs experiences, knowledge, and use of Peer Instruction, along with general questions about current and past teaching methods used by the interviewee. The primary findings include the following: (i) Faculty self-reported user status is an unreliable measure of their actual practice. (ii) Faculty generally modify specific instructional strategies and may modify out essential components. (iii) Faculty are often unaware of the essential features of an instructional strategy they claim to know about or use. (iv) Informal social interactions provide a significant communication channel in the dissemination process, in contrast to the formal avenues of workshops, papers, websites, etc., often promoted by change agents, and (v) experience with research-based strategies as a graduate student or through curriculum development work may be highly impactful. These findings indicate that educational transformation can be better facilitated by improving communication with faculty, supporting effective modification by faculty during implementation, and acknowledging and understanding the large impact of informal social interactions as a mode of dissemination.},

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.  Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

@article{kouzes1996envisioning,
  abstract = {A leader's step-by-step guide to envisioning the future - and communicating it to others.

You feel a strong desire to go on a challenging expedition to a place you've never been. It's a desire that you can't shake, something that you think about day and night.

At first, your desire for challenge is quite vague; you don't have a specific destination in mind. But soon you feel a need to decide on the kind of challenging journey that you want for yourself. You look at some alternatives: trekking through the mountains, sailing an ocean, hiking across a desert, going on a safari. Whether through conscious thought or unfocused meditation, you discover what appeals to you the most: You decide, for example, that you've always wanted to take a trek through the Himalayas.

So what do you do now? More than likely, you consult a travel guide, study maps, look at photographs. You talk to people who have climbed the Himalayas, read adventure stories by those who have done it before. You begin to get a real sense of the place - the weather, the dress, the customs, the food, the travel conditions - all those impressions that clarify your understanding of your destination.

Not wanting your trip to be just like others you've heard about, you decide that you'll make this something special. You decide that your expedition will be unique, one that no one else has ever undertaken - perhaps even one that National Geographic would want to cover.

Then you set a date many months or even years in the future. You know such arduous journeys aren't done alone, so you determine who else might share your desire for challenge and how those people would benefit from the experience. You recruit some colleagues, selling them on the benefits of high adventure. Then the planning begins in earnest.

Discovering a vision for your organization is similar in many ways to these initial stages of preparing for an expedition. You feel a strong inner sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are in your community, congregation, or company and have an equally strong belief that things don't have to be this way. Envisioning the future begins with a vague desire to do something that would challenge yourself and others.

Because you want what you create to be unique, you differentiate your organization or cause from others that produce the same product, provide the same service, or make the same promise. Yours is a distinctive vision, an ideal.

Visions for organizations or reformations or movements, as well as visions for journeys, are more complex than this, of course. And we don't necessarily follow such a sequential process for clarifying our visions - especially if we're attempting to achieve what no one has ever achieved before.

Four Attributes of Vision

Let's take a closer look at four attributes of vision, which we define as an ideal and unique image of the future.

1. Ideality: The Pursuit of Excellence

Visions are about possibilities, about desired futures. They're ideals, standards of excellence. As such, they're expressions of optimism and hope. A mode of thinking based on visions opens us up to considering possibilities, not simply probabilities.

Indeed, it is exactly this belief that sustains teacher Nolan Dishongh and helps him spark possibility thinking in students otherwise at risk. Many of the 14- to 16-year-olds in Dishongh's construction trades class at Alice Johnson Junior High, 25 miles east of Houston, have well-earned reputations as troublemakers, as students with short attention spans, low grades, and little interest in learning. Many are from broken or abusive homes; some are known gang members.

Dishongh sets the tone at the start of each school year by asking his students to lay their heads on their desks. Then, in his deep, soothing voice, he instructs them to think about their mother, about her holding them close as infants, feeding them and singing to them. },

  abstract = {While many innovative teaching strategies exist, integration into undergraduate science teaching has been frustratingly slow. This study aims to understand the low uptake of research-based instructional innovations by studying 21 successful implementations of the Student Centered Active Learning with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) instructional reform. SCALE-UP significantly restructures the classroom environment and pedagogy to promote highly active and interactive instruction. Although originally designed for university introductory physics courses, SCALE-UP has spread to many other disciplines at hundreds of departments around the world. This study reports findings from in-depth, open-ended interviews with 21 key contact people involved with successful secondary implementations of SCALE-UP throughout the United States. We defined successful implementations as those who restructured their pedagogy and classroom and sustained and/or spread the change. Interviews were coded to identify the most common enabling and challenging factors during reform implementation and compared to the theoretical framework of Kotter‚Äôs 8-step Change Model. The most common enabling influences that emerged are documenting and leveraging evidence of local success, administrative support, interaction with outside SCALE-UP user(s), and funding. Many challenges are linked to the lack of these enabling factors including difficulty finding funding, space, and administrative and/or faculty support for reform. Our focus on successful secondary implementations meant that most interviewees were able to overcome challenges. Presentation of results is illuminated with case studies, quotes, and examples that can help secondary implementers with SCALE-UP reform efforts specifically. We also discuss the implications for policy makers, researchers, and the higher education community concerned with initiating structural change.},

Citing a wide range of research in organizational behavior, medical science, and psychology as well as real-world examples, Cameron shows that to achieve exceptional success, leaders must emphasize strengths rather than simply focus on weaknesses; foster virtuous actions such as compassion, gratitude, and forgiveness; encourage contribution goals in addition to achievement goals; and enable meaningfulness in work. In this concise, inspiring, and practical guide, Cameron describes four positive leadership strategies, lays out a proven process for implementing them, and includes a self-assessment instrument.

Referencing Epstein's Generativity Theory, we designed and deployed a suite of creative thinking exercises with linkages to concepts in computer science and computational thinking, with the premise that students can leverage their creative thinking skills to "unlock" their understanding of computational thinking. In this paper, we focus on our study on differential impacts of the exercises on different student populations. For all students there was a linear "dosage effect" where completion of each additional exercise increased retention of course content. The impacts on course grades, however, were more nuanced. CS majors had a consistent increase for each exercise, while non-majors benefited more from completing at least three exercises. It was also important for freshmen to complete all four exercises. We did find differences between women and men but cannot draw conclusions.},

@article{knaub2016classroom,
  abstract = {Background: The characteristics of the classroom environment play an important role in shaping teaching practices and supporting research-based instructional strategies. One instructional strategy that has reimagined the classroom is the Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-Down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP). SCALE-UP uses studio-style instruction to facilitate student collaboration. Although there is significant interest in studio-style instruction, there is not much research-based guidance available for institutions interested in setting up a classroom, especially for secondary users interested in using this in different academic settings and contexts. We interviewed key informants involved in 21 successful secondary implementations of SCALE-UP about creating, using, and spreading studio-style classrooms. This paper summarizes respondent‚Äôs perceptions of (1) how these classrooms are initiated; (2) which classroom features are helpful, non-essential, and unhelpful; (3) how professional development efforts support SCALE-UP instructors; and (4) how the classroom indirectly affects the department and/or institution.

Results: Room initiation Interviewees engaged in multiple activities to obtain a studio-style classroom. The majority of interviewees worked in teams created by faculty or administrators, with the participation from both groups. Interviewees typically sought institutional funding to develop the rooms.

Classroom features When developing the room, implementers used many key characteristics of the recommended classroom, such as collaborative workspace (e.g., special tables) for students, but they generally did not replicate all of the recommended features. Interviewees had mixed opinions about the importance of classroom technology.

Professional development and support Interviewees noted the importance of professional development for teaching staff (instructors and teaching assistants) new to the SCALE-UP teaching environment.

Indirect effects Beyond direct benefits to the teachers and learners, our interviewees reported that the classrooms had larger impacts including attracting visitors to the institution and encouraging the use of active learning in non-SCALE-UP classes.

Conclusions: There are many paths to successful development of a studio-style classroom. The process can be initiated by faculty or administrators. Classroom designs can vary to suit the local environment as long as they maintain the intent of the space: to support peer collaboration. Beyond improving student outcomes, these classrooms have additional benefits for institutions that include transforming instructor approaches to teaching and symbolizing the institution‚Äôs commitment to quality teaching.},

Specifically, we analyzed data from interviews with 24 recent Journal of Engineering Education authors from engineer-nonengineer teams. Theoretical frameworks from education and psychology are used to ground the results and contribute to broader research on collaboration across technology and social science disciplines. The data suggest that the way an individual understands and appreciates the nature of knowledge affects the way he or she collaborates with colleagues in different academic disciplines, especially when the disciplines are fundamentally different. Although the literature criticizes engineers for not understanding or respecting other viewpoints, we found that nine engineers and eight nonengineers articulated awareness of their collaborators' perspectives, worked to integrate these into the research, and noted increased satisfaction and quality of work as a result. Recommendations for fostering this type of interdisciplinary integration in engineering education are offered along with suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {The 2001 U.S. Supreme Court Case of Falvo v. Owasso School System (Owasso Independent School District No I-011 v. Falvo) has focused national attention on the common classroom practice of peer-grading. In a unanimous decision the court reaffirmed the popular view that students grading each others‚Äô tests is valuable, saving teachers‚Äô time and augmenting student learning. Our study puts these presumed benefits to the test in 4 middle school science classrooms. We compared teacher-assigned grades to those awarded either by students to themselves or by their peers. By training students to grade with the help of a scoring rubric, a very high correlation was obtained between students and their teacher on test questions (r = 0.91 to 0.94). We found patterns of bias when students assigned grades. When grading others, students awarded lower grades to the best performing students than their teacher did. When grading themselves, lower performing students tended to inflate their own low scores. Performance on an unannounced, 2nd administration of the same test 1 week later measured the degree to which student-grading resulted in any increased understanding. Students who graded their peers‚Äôtests did not gain significantly more than a control group of students who did not correct any papers but simply took the same test again. Those students who corrected their own tests improved dramatically. Self-grading and peer-grading appear to be reasonable aids to saving teachers‚Äô time. Self-grading appears to result in increased student learning; peer-grading does not.},

The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of the E-APP and its interventions, which will be measured by increased participation rates and increased university retention rates for E-APP participants. Outcome data for the students are analyzed statistically for significant differences between the quasi-experimental groups (E-APP or not EAPP), matched based on Math ACT scores. The results show significant improvement in first-year retention rates for EAPP participants. The results of this study are both transferrable and scalable.

  abstract = {Background: Research has provided evidence on the benefits of active learning on student learning and success in the engineering classroom. Yet the adoption of such types of instruction has been slow. Prior research has suggested that students' responses may have a significant effect on instructors' willingness to adopt different types of instruction.


Purpose: We describe our method for creating an instrument to measure the effects of several variables on student response to instructional practices. We discuss the step-by-step process for creating this instrument from the initial development process through multiple stages of validity and reliability testing.


Design/Method: The process for instrument development consisted of six steps: item generation and construct development, validity testing, implementation, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and instrument modification and replication. We discuss the pilot testing of the initial instrument (n=362) as well as construct development and validation using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.

Results: This process resulted in the creation of 49 items measuring three parts of our framework. Types of instruction separated into four factors (interactive, constructive, active, and passive); strategies for using in-class activities into two factors (explanation and facilitation); and student responses to instruction into five factors (value, positivity, participation, distraction, and evaluation).

Conclusions: This study describes the design process and final results. for an instrument to measure Student Response to Instructional Practices, a useful tool for understanding the relationship between the type of instruction used and students' response.},

  abstract = {Providing students with the professional, communication, and technical skills necessary to contribute to an ongoing software project is critical, yet often difficult in higher education. Involving student teams in real-world projects developed by professional software engineers for actual users is invaluable. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has emerged as an important approach to creating, managing, and distributing software products. Involvement in a FOSS project provides students with experience developing within a professional environment, with a professional community, and has the additional benefit that all communication and artifacts are publicly accessible. Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects benefit the human condition in some manner. They can range from disaster management to microfinance to election-monitoring applications. This article discusses the benefits and challenges of students participating in HFOSS projects within the context of undergraduate computing degree programs. This article reports on a 6-year study of students' self-reported attitudes and learning from participation in an HFOSS project. Results indicate that working on an HFOSS project increases interest in computing. In addition, students perceive that they are gaining experience in developing software in a distributed environment with the attendant skills of communication, distributed teamwork, and more.},

@misc{chia2006measuring,
  abstract = {Public relations scholars have attempted to measure public relations relationships to determine whether they are satisfactory, whether relational partners trust each other and whether commitment is critical to successful relationships. These scholars point to the need to measure relationships but an essential first step is to have a clear and orderly accepted concept of what is to be measured and whether the measuring of relationships is a realistic goal. This paper suggests that relational characteristics such as commitment, trust and satisfaction are so subjective that attempts to measure them have been extremely difficult as they change with each situation, with different clients and organisations and with varied perceptions and interpretations of those in a relationship.

This paper looks at the contribution of interpersonal theory and scholarship in psychology and business management that suggests that personal and business relational dialogue is so complex that attempting to measure relationships or relationship characteristics maybe a fruitless exercise. Rather, interpersonal and business scholars, who focus on relational exchanges and relational development, point to the need to have rules for relationships that specify what is important to the relationship. Supporting the views of these scholars, the need for relational parameters for effective public relations relationship management was an important finding of a qualitative study of public relations consultants and their clients. The qualitative study also produced concepts of relationships and relationship management relevant to public relations that this paper argues extends the range of present perspectives beyond relationship indicators and beyond the measuring of immeasurable relationships.},

We found that few education developers propose strong propagation plans. Afterwards, a follow-up analysis was conducted to see which propagation strategies developers actually used to help develop, disseminate, and support their innovations. A web search and interviews with principal investigators were used to determine the degree to which propagation plans were actually implemented and to estimate adoption of the innovations. In this study, we analyzed 71 education development proposals funded by the National Science Foundation and predicted that 80% would be unsuccessful in propagating their innovations.

@article{williams2015describing,
  abstract = {Background
Collecting data on instructional practices is an important step in planning and enacting meaningful initiatives to improve undergraduate science instruction. Self-report survey instruments are one of the most common tools used for collecting data on instructional practices. This paper is an instrument- and item-level analysis of available instructional practice instruments to survey postsecondary instructional practices. We qualitatively analyzed the instruments to document their features and methodologically sorted their items into autonomous categories based on their content. The paper provides a detailed description and evaluation of the instruments, identifies gaps in the literature, and provides suggestions for proper instrument selection, use, and development based on these findings.

Results
The 12 instruments we analyzed use a variety of measurement and development approaches. There are two primary instrument types: those intended for all postsecondary instructors and those intended for instructors in a specific STEM discipline. The instruments intended for all instructors often focus on teaching as well as other aspects of faculty work. The number of teaching practice items and response scales varied widely. Most teaching practice items referred to the format of in-class instruction (54 %), such as group work or problem solving. Another important type of teaching practice items referred to assessment practices (35 %), frequently focusing on specific types of summative assessment items used.

Conclusions
The recent interest in describing teaching practices has led to the development of a diverse set of available self-report instruments. Many instruments lack an audit trail of their development, including rationale for response scales; whole instrument and construct reliability values; and face, construct, and content validity measures. Future researchers should consider building on these existing instruments to address some of their current weaknesses. In addition, there are important aspects of instruction that are not currently described in any of the available instruments. These include laboratory-based instruction, hybrid and online instructional environments, and teaching with elements of universal design},

@article{henderson2011facilitating,
  abstract = {This article reviews current scholarship about how to promote change in instructional practices used in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. The review is based on 191 conceptual and empirical journal articles published between 1995 and 2008. Four broad categories of change strategies were developed to capture core differences within this body of literature: disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, developing reflective teachers, enacting policy, and developing shared vision. STEM education researchers largely write about change in terms of disseminating curriculum and pedagogy. Faculty development researchers largely write about change in terms of developing reflective teachers. Higher education researchers largely write about change in terms of enacting policy. New work often does not build on prior empirical or theoretical work. Although most articles claim success of the change strategy studied, evidence presented to support these claims is typically not strong. For example, only 21\% of articles that studied implementation of a change strategy were categorized as presenting strong evidence to support claims of success or failure of the strategy. These analyses suggest that the state of change strategies and the study of change strategies are weak, and that research communities that study and enact change are largely isolated from one-another. In spite of the weak state of the literature, some conclusions related to the design of change strategies can be drawn from this review. Two commonly used change strategies are clearly not effective: developing and testing best practice curricular materials and then making these materials available to other faculty and top-down policy-making meant to influence instructional practices. Effective change strategies: are aligned with or seek to change the beliefs of the individuals involved; involve long-term interventions, lasting at least one semester; require understanding a college or university as a complex system and designing a strategy that is compatible with this system.},

  abstract = {Any conversation about effective teaching must begin with a consideration of how students learn. However, instructors may find a gap between resources that focus on the technical research on learning and those that provide practical classroom strategies. How Learning Works provides the bridge for such a gap. In this volume, the authors introduce seven general principles of learning, distilled from the research literature as well as from twenty-seven years of experience working one-on-one with college faculty. They have drawn on research from a breadth of perspectives (cognitive, developmental, and social psychology; educational research; anthropology; demographics; and organizational behavior) to identify a set of key principles underlying learning-from how effective organization enhances retrieval and use of information to what impacts motivation. These principles provide instructors with an understanding of student learning that can help them see why certain teaching approaches are or are not supporting student learning, generate or refine teaching approaches and strategies that more effectively foster student learning in specific contexts, and transfer and apply these principles to new courses. For anyone who wants to improve his or her students' learning, it is crucial to understand how that learning works and how to best foster it. This vital resource is grounded in learning theory and based on research evidence, while being easy to understand and apply to college teaching.},

Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.},

The learning system has been evaluated over three consecutive terms. Learn2Mine was initially introduced in an introductory course and pilot-tested for usability and effectiveness in Fall 2013. Students reported positive opinions on usability and effectiveness of the system in their completion of programming assignments. In Spring 2014, Learn2Mine was evaluated in an upper-level data mining course by comparing student submission rates and amount of programming accomplished for a group with access to the tool versus one without access. The group with access to Learn2Mine had an average assignment submission rate of 84%, while the group without had an average submission rate of only 48% (difference significant at p < 0.01). In Fall 2014, a controlled experiment was conducted in an introductory data science course: one group of students worked on a multi-part programming task with support of scaffolding and gamification as implemented in Learn2Mine, while the other section did not. The group with access performed significantly better in overall task completion (p < 0.01).},

@article{fredrickson2005positive,
  abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 68(9) of American Psychologist (see record 2013-32937-001). The hypothesis tested in this article was motivated, in part, by the nonlinear dynamic model introduced in Losada (1999) and advanced in Losada and Heaphy (2004) and herein (Fredrickson & Losada, 2005). This model has since been called into question (Brown, Sokal, & Friedman, 2013). Losada has chosen not to defend his nonlinear dynamic model in light of the Brown et al. critique. Fredrickson‚Äôs (2013) published response to the Brown et al. critique conveys that although she had accepted Losada‚Äôs modeling as valid, she has since come to question it. As such, the modeling element of this article is formally withdrawn as invalid and, along with it, the model-based predictions about the particular positivity ratios of 2.9 and 11.6. Other elements of the article remain valid and are unaffected by this correction notice. Some of these notable elements are included in the erratum.] Extending B. L. Fredrickson's (1998) broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions and M. Losada's (1999) nonlinear dynamics model of team performance, the authors predict that a ratio of positive to negative affect at or above 2.9 will characterize individuals in flourishing mental health. Participants (N=188) completed an initial survey to identify flourishing mental health and then provided daily reports of experienced positive and negative emotions over 28 days. Results showed that the mean ratio of positive to negative affect was above 2.9 for individuals classified as flourishing and below that threshold for those not flourishing. Together with other evidence, these findings suggest that a set of general mathematical principles may describe the relations between positive affect and human flourishing.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION:
Nowadays, knowledge extraction methods from Next Generation Sequencing data are highly requested. In this work, we focus on RNA-seq gene expression analysis and specifically on case-control studies with rule-based supervised classification algorithms that build a model able to discriminate cases from controls. State of the art algorithms compute a single classification model that contains few features (genes). On the contrary, our goal is to elicit a higher amount of knowledge by computing many classification models, and therefore to identify most of the genes related to the predicted class.
RESULTS:
We propose CAMUR, a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent classification models. CAMUR iteratively computes a rule-based classification model, calculates the power set of the genes present in the rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set, and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified. CAMUR includes an ad-hoc knowledge repository (database) and a querying tool.We analyze three different types of RNA-seq data sets (Breast, Head and Neck, and Stomach Cancer) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and we validate CAMUR and its models also on non-TCGA data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of CAMUR: we obtain several reliable equivalent classification models, from which the most frequent genes, their relationships, and the relation with a particular cancer are deduced.},

  abstract = {The mathematics performance of students enrolling in the engineering technology subjects such as robotics, image processing, control systems and others have been degraded at an alarming rate during the recent years. One of the reasons for this scenario is their inability to relate the mathematical knowledge with the technical applications including image processing. The inconsistency of terminologies used in mathematics and technical subjects has been identified as one of the main sources that contribute to this problem. In this paper, the mapping of the terminologies used in mathematics and image processing was done. It is found that there are different terminologies used in both subjects carry the same meaning and also some same terminologies used in both subjects represent different meanings. Thus it is recommended that lecturers teaching both subjects to introduce the variety of terminologies in defining a newly taught concept for teaching and learning of mathematics and image processing subjects.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that some students learn to program with the goal of becoming conversational programmers: they want to develop programming literacy skills not to write code in the future but mainly to develop conversational skills and communicate better with developers and to improve their marketability. To investigate the existence of such a population of conversational programmers in practice, we surveyed professionals at a large multinational technology company who were not in software development roles. Based on 3151 survey responses from professionals who never or rarely wrote code, we found that a significant number of them (42.6%) had invested in learning programming on the job. While many of these respondents wanted to perform traditional end-user programming tasks (e.g., data analysis), we discovered that two top motivations for learning programming were to improve the efficacy of technical conversations and to acquire marketable skillsets. The main contribution of this work is in empirically establishing the existence and characteristics of conversational programmers in a large software development context.},

@book{williams2016syntaxbased,
  abstract = {This unique book provides a comprehensive introduction to the most popular syntax-based statistical machine translation models, filling a gap in the current literature for researchers and developers in human language technologies. While phrase-based models have previously dominated the field, syntax-based approaches have proved a popular alternative, as they elegantly solve many of the shortcomings of phrase-based models. The heart of this book is a detailed introduction to decoding for syntax-based models.

The book begins with an overview of synchronous-context free grammar (SCFG) and synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) along with their associated statistical models. It also describes how three popular instantiations (Hiero, SAMT, and GHKM) are learned from parallel corpora. It introduces and details hypergraphs and associated general algorithms, as well as algorithms for decoding with both tree and string input. Special attention is given to efficiency, including search approximations such as beam search and cube pruning, data structures, and parsing algorithms. The book consistently highlights the strengths (and limitations) of syntax-based approaches, including their ability to generalize phrase-based translation units, their modeling of specific linguistic phenomena, and their function of structuring the search space.

@book{brown2014stick,
  abstract = {To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned. Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.},

The activity involves working with a digital camera, taking, capturing and saving images, and exploring pixel values and their relationship to image brightness and colour. We also perform some elementary processing tasks: thresholding, changing spatial resolution and quantization. Students then have a brief introduction to spatial filtering, followed by some examples: image blurring and edge detection. The activity finishes with some binary morphology. Given that digital image processing is usually offered only at the upper undergraduate or postgraduate level, we have demonstrated that it is quite possible to introduce some image processing concepts in a friendly and supportive environment to students in the middle years of their secondary schooling.},

The second survey asked a different pool of software engineers to rate these 145 questions and identify the most important ones to work on first. Respondents favored questions that focus on how customers typically use their applications. We also saw opposition to questions that assess the performance of individual employees or compare them with one another.

While there has been extensive research into what industry requires of graduates in the workplace, little research is available about students' perceptions of graduate employability and how they feel it should be addressed in the curriculum. This paper draws of the findings from a nationally commissioned Australian study involving multiple institutions and multiple disciplines, aimed at aligning the employability skills expectations of employers, professional bodies, academic staff, graduates and students. The focus of this paper however is around ICT students' perceptions of graduate employability and the exploration of ways in which employability skills can be developed in graduates in the discipline of ICT. As a subset of the broader commissioned study, we ran focus groups with three cohorts of information, communication and technology (ICT) students from two Australian universities. Our key research areas investigated students' perceptions of the skills ICT employers are looking for, and ways to improve ICT students' employability. In addition, insights into students' feelings of their preparedness for work between the three focus groups cohorts are provided. The research questions were analysed thematically with a qualitative open coding approach based on themes drawn from the Fullen and Scott (2014) employability framework. Overall, while students realized the importance of discipline knowledge and technical skills, other generic skills were also acknowledged. The participants also had ideas in terms of how employability skills should be enhanced.},

  abstract = {Cancer and healthy cells have distinct distributions of molecular properties and thus respond differently to drugs. Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells while limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among cells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of selective drug action. Here we formalize a classification framework based on the idea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and healthy cells. More specifically, this discrimination should be performed on the basis of measurable cell markers. We divide the problem into three parts which we explore with examples. First, molecular markers should discriminate cancer cells from healthy cells at the single-cell level. Second, the effects of drugs should be statistically predicted by these molecular markers. Third, drugs should be optimized for classification performance. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to discriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We also find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of some cancer drugs, suggesting that these cancer drugs act as suboptimal classifiers using gene profiles. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and predicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the individual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a discrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers promises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails.},

@book{kuhn2013applied,
  abstract = {This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics. Dr. Kuhn is a Director of Non-Clinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R & D in Groton Connecticut. He has been applying predictive models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 15 years and is the author of a number of R packages. Dr. Johnson has more than a decade of statistical consulting and predictive modeling experience in pharmaceutical research and development. He is a co-founder of Arbor Analytics, a firm specializing in predictive modeling and is a former Director of Statistics at Pfizer Global R & D. His scholarly work centers on the application and development of statistical methodology and learning algorithms. Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning. The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems. Addressing practical concerns extends beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance, selecting predictors, and pinpointing causes of poor model performance-all of which are problems that occur frequently in practice. The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples. And every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process. The data sets and corresponding code are available in the book's companion AppliedPredictiveModeling R package, which is freely available on the CRAN archive. This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner's reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses. To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book's R package. Readers and students interested in implementing the methods should have some basic knowledge of R. And a handful of the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.},

  abstract = {Our primary motivation in writing this book is to share our working experience to bridge the gap between the knowledge of industry gurus and newcomers to the spoken language processing community. Many powerful techniques hide in conference proceedings and academic papers for years before becoming widely recognized by the research community or the industry. We spent many years pursuing spoken language technology research at Carnegie Mellon University before we started spoken language R&D at Microsoft. We fully understand that it is by no means a small undertaking to transfer a state-of-the-art spoken language research system into a commercially viable product that can truly help people improve their productivity. Our experience in both industry and academia is reflected in the context of this book, which presents a contemporary and comprehensive description of both theoretic and practical issues in spoken language processing. This book is intended for people of diverse academic and practical backgrounds. Speech scientists, computer scientists, linguists, engineers, physicists, and psychologists all have a unique perspective on spoken language processing. This book will be useful to all of these special interest groups.

Spoken language processing is a diverse subject that relies on knowledge of many levels, including acoustics, phonology, phonetics, linguistics, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse. The diverse nature of spoken language processing requires knowledge in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, syntax, and psychology. There are a number of excellent books on the subfields of spoken language processing, including speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and spoken language understanding, but there is no single book that covers both theoretical and practical aspects of these subfields and spoken language interface design. We devote many chapters systematically introducing fundamental theories needed to understand how speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and spoken language understanding work. Even more important is the fact that the book highlights what works well in practice, which is invaluable if you want to build a practical speech recognizer, a practical text-to-speech synthesizer, or a practical spoken language system. Using numerous real examples in developing Microsoft's spoken language systems, we concentrate on showing how the fundamental theories can be applied to solve real problems in spoken language processing.},

Millions of professionals in fields ranging from science, engineering, business, finance, public policy, and journalism, as well as numerous students and computer hobbyists, all perform research programming on a daily basis.

My thesis is that by understanding the unique challenges faced during research programming, it becomes possible to apply techniques from dynamic program analysis, mixed-initiative recommendation systems, and OS-level tracing to make research programmers more productive.

This dissertation characterizes the research programming process, describes typical challenges faced by research programmers, and presents five software tools that I have developed to address some key challenges. 1.) Proactive Wrangler is an interactive graphical tool that helps research programmers reformat and clean data prior to analysis. 2.) IncPy is a Python interpreter that speeds up the data analysis scripting cycle and helps programmers manage code and data dependencies. 3.) SlopPy is a Python interpreter that automatically makes existing scripts error-tolerant, thereby also speeding up the data analysis scripting cycle. 4.) Burrito is a Linux-based system that helps programmers organize, annotate, and recall past insights about their experiments. 5.) CDE is a software packaging tool that makes it easy to deploy, archive, and share research code. Taken together, these five tools enable research programmers to iterate and potentially discover insights faster by offloading the burdens of data management and provenance to the computer.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes‚Äîalthough the greatest effects are in small $(n \le 50)$ classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

@book{mcandrew2011introduction,
  abstract = {Once the privilege of a secret few, cryptography is now taught at universities around the world. Introduction to Cryptography with Open-Source Software illustrates algorithms and cryptosystems using examples and the open-source computer algebra system of Sage. The author, a noted educator in the field, provides a highly practical learning experience by progressing at a gentle pace, keeping mathematics at a manageable level, and including numerous end-of-chapter exercises.

Focusing on the cryptosystems themselves rather than the means of breaking them, the book first explores when and how the methods of modern cryptography can be used and misused. It then presents number theory and the algorithms and methods that make up the basis of cryptography today. After a brief review of "classical" cryptography, the book introduces information theory and examines the public-key cryptosystems of RSA and Rabin‚Äôs cryptosystem. Other public-key systems studied include the El Gamal cryptosystem, systems based on knapsack problems, and algorithms for creating digital signature schemes.

The second half of the text moves on to consider bit-oriented secret-key, or symmetric, systems suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. The author describes block ciphers (including the Data Encryption Standard), cryptographic hash functions, finite fields, the Advanced Encryption Standard, cryptosystems based on elliptical curves, random number generation, and stream ciphers. The book concludes with a look at examples and applications of modern cryptographic systems, such as multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfer, and voting protocols.},

From physical sciences to numerical simulations to high throughput genomics and homeland security, we are soon dealing with Petabytes if not Exabytes of data. This new, data-centric computing requires a new look at computing architectures and strategies. We will revisit Amdahl's Law establishing the relation between CPU and I/O in a balanced computer system, and use this to analyze current computing architectures and workloads. We will discuss how existing hardware can be used to build systems that are much closer to an ideal Amdahl machine. We have deployed various scientific applications, mostly drawn from astronomy, over different architectures and compare performance and scaling laws. We discuss a hypothetical cheap, yet high performance multi-petabyte system currently under consideration at JHU. We will also explore strategies of interacting with very large amounts of data, and compare various large scale data analysis platforms.},

But such heavy mathematics does not form the background of many students of computer science. In Australia, some tertiary courses are phasing formal mathematics out of their computer science courses completely. This means that the effective teaching of image processing to students of computer science must use as little mathematics as possible.

@book{barrett2005appreciative,
  abstract = {Within these pages is a simple yet revolutionary philosophy of organizational learning and change: discover everything that "gives life" to the cooperative capacity of a human system‚Äîand then let go.

What gets co-constructed thereafter will be anything but linear. Like jazz improvisation or a creative jam session, it will literally be impossible to predict the emerging new opportunities, options, and shared possibilities. But one thing is almost certain: whatever gets created will be good. It will be valued and valuable to the human system for one overarching reason: the quality of the "relational space" from which the new constructions of the future are nurtured makes a difference that makes the difference. Relationships, propose the authors of this wonderful introduction to Appreciative Inquiry, come alive where there is an appreciative question, when there is a deliberate search for the good and the best in one another; and in human systems the process of studying a phenomenon actually changes that phenomenon, in effect creating a new reality during the process of inquiry. That‚Äôs what this book is all about. It is all about power of "AI" as a way of creating a relational space for the cooperative construction of reality.

Based on almost twenty years of field research in organizations like the United States Navy, Roadway Express, and Nokia as well as years of scholarly commitment to social constructionist approaches to human science inquiry, the authors of this book finally put into print a pragmatic, inspiring, and simple account of an approach to strength-based change that has elevated the capacities of thousands of businesses, change leaders, and teams to realize their enormous potentials. It‚Äôs the kind of focus book that people will want to hand out at the front end of a major organization-wide change initiative. And it is a perfect companion piece for workshops, foundation courses on AI, and leadership programs.},

@inproceedings{wolpaw2012braincomputer,
  abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have a promising future, with researchers in laboratories all over the world using many different brain signals, recording methods, and signal processing approaches to realize increasingly capable systems. These BCI systems can control a variety of external devices, from cursors and avatars on computer screens, to televisions and wheelchairs, to robotic arms and neuroprostheses. People with and without disabilities have tested these systems, and a few people who are severely disabled are already using them for important purposes in their daily lives. Furthermore, several groups are beginning to explore BCI-based methods for improving rehabilitation for people with strokes and other neuromuscular disorders. Thus, BCIs are poised to become a major new technology for people with disabilities, and possibly for the general population as well. At the same time, the realization of this bright future depends on advances in four critical areas. First, both non-invasive and invasive BCIs need better signal-acquisition hardware. Second, the real-life usefulness of BCI systems for people with disabilities requires convincing clinical validation. Third, effective strategies for BCI dissemination and ongoing support must be developed. Fourth, and perhaps most important, if non-invasive or invasive BCIs are to be widely used for anything more than the most basic communication functions, their reliability must be greatly improved. Better reliability may be achieved with BCI design strategies that are based on the principles underlying the excellent reliability of natural neuromuscular actions. These strategies include: effective engagement of brain adaptive capacities; task-appropriate distribution of control between the brain and the BCI; and BCI use of signals from multiple brain areas. Effective attention to these critical areas by scientists and engineers throughout the world can realize the exciting future envisioned for BCI technology.},

Leading consumer Web companies such as Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Google and LinkedIn, as well as B2B companies like Salesforce, possess Petabytes of data. Through effective mining of this data, they create products and services that benefit millions of users and generate tremendous amount of business value. It is widely acknowledged that Data Scientists play key roles in the creation of these products, from pattern identification, idea generation and product prototyping to experiment design and launch decisions. Nonetheless, they also face common challenges, such as the gap between creating a prototype and turning it into a scalable product, or the frustration of generating innovative product ideas that do not get adopted. Organizers of this tutorial have many years of experience leading Data Science teams in some of the most successful consumer Web companies. In this tutorial, we introduce the framework that we created to nurture data-driven product innovations. The core of this framework is the focus on scale and impact - we take the audience through a discussion on how to balance between velocity and scale, between product innovation and product operation, and between theoretical research and practical impact. We also share some guidelines for successful data-driven product innovation with real examples from our experiences.  We end the tutorial by discussing the organizational perspective of data-driven product innovation: how to structure Data Science teams so Data Scientists collaborate effectively with other functions, and how to hire and grow talents into Data Scientist roles.},

OverCode uses both static and dynamic analysis to cluster similar solutions, and lets teachers further filter and cluster solutions based on different criteria. We evaluated OverCode against a nonclustering baseline in a within-subjects study with 24 teaching assistants and found that the OverCode interface allows teachers to more quickly develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions, and to provide feedback that is relevant to more students' solutions.},

  abstract = {Urban growth is a worldwide phenomenon but the rate of urbanization is very fast in developing country like Egypt. It is mainly driven by unorganized expansion, increased immigration, rapidly increasing population. In this context, land use and land cover change are considered one of the central components in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental changes. In Egypt, urban growth has brought serious losses of agricultural land and water bodies. Urban growth is responsible for a variety of urban environmental issues like decreased air quality, increased runoff and subsequent flooding, increased local temperature, deterioration of water quality, etc. Egypt possessed a number of fast growing cities. Mansoura and Talkha cities in Daqahlia governorate are expanding rapidly with varying growth rates and patterns. In this context, geospatial technologies and remote sensing methodology provide essential tools which can be applied in the analysis of land use change detection. This paper is an attempt to assess the land use change detection by using GIS in Mansoura and Talkha from 1985 to 2010. Change detection analysis shows that built-up area has been increased from 28 to 255 km2 by more than 30\% and agricultural land reduced by 33\%. Future prediction is done by using the Markov chain analysis. Information on urban growth, land use and land cover change study is very useful to local government and urban planners for the betterment of future plans of sustainable development of the city.},

The lack of relevance of these equations and their incorrect application lead us to conclude that Fredrickson and Losada's claim to have demonstrated the existence of a critical minimum positivity ratio of 2.9013 is entirely unfounded. More generally, we urge future researchers to exercise caution in the use of advanced mathematical tools, such as nonlinear dynamics, and in particular to verify that the elementary conditions for their valid application have been met.},

A small secondary set of news texts with artificially inserted misspellings are used to tune confidence classifiers. Because no manual annotation is required, our system can easily be instantiated for new languages. When evaluated on human typed data with real misspellings in English and German, our web-based systems outperform baselines which use candidate corrections based on hand-curated dictionaries.

@article{sorin2011primer,
  abstract = {Many modern computer systems and most multicore chips (chip multiprocessors) support shared memory in hardware. In a shared memory system, each of the processor cores may read and write to a single shared address space. For a shared memory machine, the memory consistency model defines the architecturally visible behavior of its memory system. Consistency definitions provide rules about loads and stores (or memory reads and writes) and how they act upon memory. As part of supporting a memory consistency model, many machines also provide cache coherence protocols that ensure that multiple cached copies of data are kept up-to-date. The goal of this primer is to provide readers with a basic understanding of consistency and coherence. This understanding includes both the issues that must be solved as well as a variety of solutions. We present both highlevel concepts as well as specific, concrete examples from real-world systems.

@inproceedings{guo2015codeopticon,
  abstract = {One-on-one tutoring from a human expert is an effective way for novices to overcome learning barriers in complex domains such as computer programming. But there are usually far fewer experts than learners. To enable a single expert to help more learners at once, we built Codeopticon, an interface that enables a programming tutor to monitor and chat with dozens of learners in real time. Each learner codes in a workspace that consists of an editor, compiler, and visual debugger. The tutor sees a real-time view of each learner's actions on a dashboard, with each learner's workspace summarized in a tile. At a glance, the tutor can see how learners are editing and debugging their code, and what errors they are encountering. The dashboard automatically reshuffles tiles so that the most active learners are always in the tutor's main field of view. When the tutor sees that a particular learner needs help, they can open an embedded chat window to start a one-on-one conversation. A user study showed that 8 first-time Codeopticon users successfully tutored anonymous learners from 54 countries in a naturalistic online setting. On average, in a 30-minute session, each tutor monitored 226 learners, started 12 conversations, exchanged 47 chats, and helped 2.4 learners.},

  abstract = {Unfortunately, most of us have little sense of our talents and strengths, much less the ability to build our lives around them. Instead, guided by our parents, by our teachers, by our managers, and by psychology's fascination with pathology, we become experts in our weaknesses and spend our lives trying to repair these flaws, while our strengths lie dormant and neglected.

Marcus Buckingham, coauthor of the national bestseller First, Break All the Rules, and Donald O. Clifton, Chair of the Gallup International Research & Education Center, have created a revolutionary program to help readers identify their talents, build them into strengths, and enjoy consistent, near-perfect performance. At the heart of the book is the Internet-based StrengthsFinder¬Æ Profile, the product of a 25-year, multimillion-dollar effort to identify the most prevalent human strengths. The program introduces 34 dominant "themes" with thousands of possible combinations, and reveals how they can best be translated into personal and career success. In developing this program, Gallup has conducted psychological profiles with more than two million individuals to help readers learn how to focus and perfect these themes.

So how does it work? This book contains a unique identification number that allows you access to the StrengthsFinder Profile on the Internet. This Web-based interview analyzes your instinctive reactions and immediately presents you with your five most powerful signature themes. Once you know which of the 34 themes -- such as Achiever, Activator, Empathy, Futuristic, or Strategic -- you lead with, the book will show you how to leverage them for powerful results at three levels: for your own development, for your success as a manager, and for the success of your organization.

With accessible and profound insights on how to turn talents into strengths, and with the immediate on-line feedback of StrengthsFinder at its core, Now, Discover Your Strengths is one of the most groundbreaking and useful business books ever written.},

The book provides practical guidance on combining methods and tools from computer science, statistics, and social science. This concrete approach is illustrated throughout using an important national problem, the quantitative study of innovation.

The text draws on the expertise of prominent leaders in statistics, the social sciences, data science, and computer science to teach students how to use modern social science research principles as well as the best analytical and computational tools. It uses a real-world challenge to introduce how these tools are used to identify and capture appropriate data, apply data science models and tools to that data, and recognize and respond to data errors and limitations.
The world has changed for empirical social scientists. The new types of ‚Äúbig data‚Äù have generated an entire new research field‚Äîthat of data science. That world is dominated by computer scientists who have generated new ways of creating and collecting data, developed new analytical and statistical techniques, and provided new ways of visualizing and presenting information. These new sources of data and techniques have the potential to transform the way applied social science is done.

Research has certainly changed. Researchers draw on data that are ‚Äúfound‚Äù rather than ‚Äúmade‚Äù by federal agencies; those publishing in leading academic journals are much less likely today to draw on preprocessed survey data.

The way in which data are used has also changed for both government agencies and businesses. Chief data officers are becoming as common in federal and state governments as chief economists were decades ago, and in cities like New York and Chicago, mayoral offices of data analytics have the ability to provide rapid answers to important policy questions. But since federal, state, and local agencies lack the capacity to do such analysis themselves, they must make these data available either to consultants or to the research community. Businesses are also learning that making effective use of their data assets can have an impact on their bottom line.

And the jobs have changed. The new job title of ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù is highlighted in job advertisements on CareerBuilder.com and Burning-glass.com‚Äîin the same category as statisticians, economists, and other quantitative social scientists if starting salaries are useful indicators.

The goal of this book is to provide social scientists with an understanding of the key elements of this new science, its value, and the opportunities for doing better work. The goal is also to identify the many ways in which the analytical toolkits possessed by social scientists can be brought to bear to enhance the generalizability of the work done by computer scientists.

We take a pragmatic approach, drawing on our experience of working with data. Most social scientists set out to solve a real- world social or economic problem: they frame the problem, identify the data, do the analysis, and then draw inferences. At all points, of course, the social scientist needs to consider the ethical ramifications of their work, particularly respecting privacy and confidentiality. The book follows the same structure. We chose a particular problem‚Äîthe link between research investments and innovation‚Äî because that is a major social science policy issue, and one in which social scientists have been addressing using big data techniques. While the example is specific and intended to show how abstract concepts apply in practice, the approach is completely generalizable. The web scraping, linkage, classification, and text analysis methods on display here are canonical in nature. The inference and privacy and confidentiality issues are no different than in any other study involving human subjects, and the communication of results through visualization is similarly generalizable.},

Such techniques are widely applied in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. This book is designed for a short course on machine learning. It is a short course, not a hurried course. From over a decade of teaching this material, we have distilled what we believe to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. In addition, our readers are given free access to online e-Chapters that we update with the current trends in Machine Learning, such as deep learning and support vector machines. We chose the title `learning from data' that faithfully describes what the subject is about, and made it a point to cover the topics in a story-like fashion. Our hope is that the reader can learn all the fundamentals of the subject by reading the book cover to cover. Learning from data has distinct theoretical and practical tracks. In this book, we balance the theoretical and the practical, the mathematical and the heuristic. Theory that establishes the conceptual framework for learning is included, and so are heuristics that impact the performance of real learning systems. What we have emphasized are the necessary fundamentals that give any student of learning from data a solid foundation.},

In this paper we present first steps towards an automated, scalable system for matching learners with Python programmers who have expertise in different areas. The learner matching system builds a knowledge model for each programmer by analyzing their authored code and extracting features that capture domain knowledge and style. We demonstrate the feasibility of a simple model that counts the references to modules from the standard library and Python Package Index in a programmers' code. We also show that programmers exhibit self-selection using which we can extract the modules a programmer is best at, even though we may not have all of their code. In our future work we aim to extend the model to encapsulate more features, and apply it for skill matching in a programming class as well as personalizing answers on StackOverflow.},

After six years, a large number of workflows are available and regularly used to run biomedical data analysis experiments on distributed infrastructures, mostly on grids. In this paper we present our first efforts to better understand and characterise these workflows. We start with a set of considerations previously proposed in the literature (workflow dimensions and motifs), and revise these to more closely describe what we observe in our workflows. We conclude that workflow characteristics can be categorized at two levels: firstly, the features characterizing the distributed application and how to implement it as a workflow, and secondly, workflow motifs that depend on the features of the selected workflow management system. These characteristics could be useful in the future to understand a larger set of workflows and to identify functional requirements for further development workflow management systems.},

These models are eminently effective for an economy premised on physical production but are not well-suited for a more knowledge-oriented economy. Complexity science suggests a different paradigm for leadership‚Äîone that frames leadership as a complex interactive dynamic from which adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning, innovation, and adaptability) emerge. This article draws from complexity science to develop an overarching framework for the study of Complexity Leadership Theory, a leadership paradigm that focuses on enabling the learning, creative, and adaptive capacity of complex adaptive systems (CAS) within a context of knowledge-producing organizations. This conceptual framework includes three entangled leadership roles (i.e., adaptive leadership, administrative leadership, and enabling leadership) that reflect a dynamic relationship between the bureaucratic, administrative functions of the organization and the emergent, informal dynamics of complex adaptive systems (CAS).},

A key aspect of this work is the use of semantic workflows to capture and reuse end-to-end analytic methods that experts would use to analyze big data, and the use of an intelligent workflow system to elaborate the workflow and manage its execution and resulting datasets. Through the exposure of big data analytics in a workflow framework, students will be able to get first-hand experiences with a breadth of big data topics, including multi-step data analytic and statistical methods, software reuse and composition, parallel distributed programming, high-end computing. In addition, students learn about a range of topics in AI, including semantic representations and ontologies, machine learning, natural language processing, and image analysis.},

  abstract = {Cryptography has become an important topic in undergraduate curricula in mathematics and computer science, not just for its intrinsic interest -- about the most fun you can have with mathematics, but for its current standing as the basis for almost all computer security. From wireless networking to secure email to password protection, cryptographic methods are used to secure information, to protect users, and to protect data.

At Victoria University, cryptography has been taught as part of a mathematics and computer science degree for several years. The students all have had at least a year of tertiary mathematics, and some exposure to a computer algebra system (Maple). However, the cost of Maple, and the current licensing agreement, means that students are unable to experiment with the software away from the computer laboratories at the University. For this reason we have decided to investigate the use of open-source computer algebra systems Maxima and Axiom. Although not as full-featured and powerful as the commercial systems Maple and Mathematica, we show they are in fact admirably suited for a subject such as cryptography. In some ways Maxima and Axiom even surpass Maple and Mathematica. Student response to the introduction of these systems has been very positive.},

  abstract = {Graduating computer science and software engineering students do not always possess the necessary skills, abilities, or knowledge when beginning their careers in the software industry. The lack of these skills and abilities can limit the productivity of newly hired, recent graduates, or even prevent them from gaining employment. This paper presents the results of an empirical study where twenty-three managers and hiring personnel from various software companies in the United States and Europe were interviewed. Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment. This research is intended to assist educators in identifying areas where students may not measure up the expectations of industry companies and in improving the curriculum at their universities to better prepare them for their future careers.},

  abstract = {Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. This problem is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a colorization Turing test, asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans on 32\% of the trials, significantly higher than previous methods. Moreover, we show that colorization can be a powerful pretext task for self-supervised feature learning, acting as a cross-channel encoder. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on several feature learning benchmarks.},

In the present article, I draw recent empirical evidence together to support the continued value of computing and seeking to elevate positivity ratios. I also underscore the necessity of modeling nonlinear effects of positivity ratios and, more generally, the value of systems science approaches within affective science and positive psychology. Even when scrubbed of Losada‚Äôs now-questioned mathematical modeling, ample evidence continues to support the conclusion that, within bounds, higher positivity ratios are predictive of flourishing mental health and other beneficial outcomes.

The Host Pathogen Interactions (HPI) teaching team is composed of research and teaching faculty with expertise in HPI who share the goal of improving the learning experience of students in nine linked undergraduate microbiology courses. To support evidence-based curriculum reform, we administered our HPI Concept Inventory as a pre- and post-survey to approximately 400 students each year since 2006. The resulting data include student scores as well as their open-ended explanations for distractor choices. The data have enabled us to address curriculum reform goals of 1) reconciling student learning with our expectations, 2) correlating student learning with background variables, 3) understanding student learning across institutions, 4) measuring the effect of teaching techniques on student learning, and 5) demonstrating how our courses collectively form a learning progression. The analysis of the concept inventory data has anchored and deepened the team‚Äôs discussions of student learning. Reading and discussing students‚Äô responses revealed the gap between our understanding and the students‚Äô understanding.

Retrieval practice, or the use of quizzes and exams to engage and enhance retrieval processes, has been widely established as an effective strategy for facilitating learning in laboratory settings (e.g., Roediger et al.                2011c). In this article, we review recent findings from applied research that demonstrate that retrieval practice enhances long-term classroom learning, delayed quizzes are particularly potent for retention, quizzes benefit students' transfer to novel quiz items, and quizzes with feedback improve students' learning and metacognitive awareness. In addition to generating evidence to support retrieval-based learning, these applied research studies also enhanced the professional development of the teachers, administrators, and scientists involved in the project. In this article, it is our hope that by sharing what we have learned from a variety of perspectives, applied scientific research in K-12 classrooms will continue to be explored and generated at local, state, and national levels, improving student learning and educational decision-making.},

  abstract = {Have you ever wanted to learn a language or pick up an instrument, only to become too daunted by the task at hand? Expert performance guru Anders Ericsson has made a career studying chess champions, violin virtuosos, star athletes, and memory mavens. Peak condenses three decades of original research to introduce an incredibly powerful approach to learning that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about acquiring a skill. Ericsson's findings have been lauded and debated, but never properly explained. So the idea of expertise still intimidates us -- we believe we need innate talent to excel, or think excelling seems prohibitively difficult. Peak belies both of these notions, proving that almost all of us have the seeds of excellence within us -- it's just a question of nurturing them by reducing expertise to a discrete series of attainable practices. Peak offers invaluable, often counterintuitive, advice on setting goals, getting feedback, identifying patterns, and motivating yourself. Whether you want to stand out at work, or help your kid achieve academic goals, Ericsson's revolutionary methods will show you how to master nearly anything.},

@article{alyahya2014ontologybased,
  abstract = {With recent advancements in Semantic Web technologies, a new trend in MCQ item generation has emerged through the use of ontologies. Ontologies are knowledge representation structures that formally describe entities in a domain and their relationships, thus enabling automated inference and reasoning. Ontology-based MCQ item generation is still in its infancy, but substantial research efforts are being made in the field. However, the applicability of these models for use in an educational setting has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of an ontology-based MCQ item generation system known as OntoQue. The evaluation was conducted using two different domain ontologies. The findings of this study show that ontology-based MCQ generation systems produce satisfactory MCQ items to a certain extent. However, the evaluation also revealed a number of shortcomings with current ontology-based MCQ item generation systems with regard to the educational significance of an automatically constructed MCQ item, the knowledge level it addresses, and its language structure. Furthermore, for the task to be successful in producing high-quality MCQ items for learning assessments, this study suggests a novel, holistic view that incorporates learning content, learning objectives, lexical knowledge, and scenarios into a single cohesive framework.},

@article{dunlosky2013improving,
  abstract = {Some students seem to breeze through their school years, whereas others struggle, putting them at risk for getting lost in our educational system and not reaching their full potential. Parents and teachers want to help students succeed, but there is little guidance on which learning techniques are the most effective for improving educational outcomes. This leads students to implement studying strategies that are often ineffective, resulting in minimal gains in performance. What then are the best strategies to help struggling students learn?

Fortunately for students, parents, and teachers, psychological scientists have developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a wide range of learning techniques meant to enhance academic performance. In this report, Dunlosky (Kent State University), Rawson (Kent State University), Marsh (Duke University), Nathan (University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison), and Willingham (University of Virginia) review the effectiveness of 10 commonly used learning techniques.

The authors describe each learning technique in detail and discuss the conditions under which each technique is most successful. They also describe the students (age, ability level, etc.) for whom each technique is most useful, the materials needed to utilize each technique, and the specific skills each technique promotes. To allow readers to easily identify which methods are the most effective, the authors rate the techniques as having high, medium, or low utility for improving student learning.

Which learning techniques made the grade? According to the authors, some commonly used techniques, such as underlining, rereading material, and using mnemonic devices, were found to be of surprisingly low utility. These techniques were difficult to implement properly and often resulted in inconsistent gains in student performance. Other learning techniques such as taking practice tests and spreading study sessions out over time ‚Äî known as distributed practice ‚Äî were found to be of high utility because they benefited students of many different ages and ability levels and enhanced performance in many different areas.

The real-world guidance provided by this report is based on psychological science, making it an especially valuable tool for students, parents, and teachers who wish to promote effective learning. Although there are many reasons why students struggle in school, these learning techniques, when used properly, should help provide meaningful gains in classroom performance, achievement test scores, and many other tasks students will encounter across their lifespan.},

However, establishing direct causality between neural activity during REMS and memory consolidation has proven difficult because of the transient nature of REMS and significant caveats associated with REMS deprivation techniques. In mice, we optogenetically silenced medial septum Œ≥-aminobutyric acid‚Äìreleasing (MSGABA) neurons, allowing for temporally precise attenuation of the memory-associated theta rhythm during REMS without disturbing sleeping behavior. REMS-specific optogenetic silencing of MSGABA neurons selectively during a REMS critical window after learning erased subsequent novel object place recognition and impaired fear-conditioned contextual memory. Silencing MSGABA neurons for similar durations outside REMS episodes had no effect on memory. These results demonstrate that MSGABA neuronal activity specifically during REMS is required for normal memory consolidation.},

@article{dunlosky2013strengthening,
  abstract = {Before the "big test" did you use the following study strategies: highlighting, rereading, and cramming? As students many of us probably did, yet research shows that while these three strategies are commonly used, they have been ineffective in retaining information. Learning strategies have been discussed in almost every textbook on educational psychology, so many teachers likely have been introduced to at least some of them, but, given the demands of day-to-day teaching, teachers do not always have time to figure out which strategies are best to use. Dunlosky reports that in his years of research he has discovered learning strategies that have proved successful and should be part of the "Student Toolbox" to boost learning. This article presents ten learning strategies for students and then expands on their usage. They are: (1) Practice testing: self-testing or taking practice tests on to-be-learned material; (2) Distributed practice: implementing a schedule of practice that spreads out study activities over time; (3) Interleaved practice: implementing a schedule of practice that mixes different kinds of problems, or a schedule of study that mixes different kinds of material, within a single study session; (4) Elaborative interrogation: generating an explanation for why an explicitly stated fact or concept is true; (5) Self-explanation: explaining how new information is related to known information, or explaining steps taken during problem solving; (6) Rereading: restudying text material again after an initial reading; (7) Highlighting and underlining: marking potentially important portions of to-be-learned materials while reading.; (8) Summarization: writing summaries (of various lengths) of to-be-learned texts; (9) Keyword mnemonic: using keywords and mental imagery to associate verbal materials; and (10) Imagery for text: attempting to form mental images of text materials while reading or listening. Using learning strategies can increase student understanding and achievement, but are only effective if students are motivated to use them correctly. Teaching students how to guide their learning of content using effective strategies will allow them to successfully learn throughout their lifetime.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we have laid out a theory of sensemaking that might be useful for intelligent systems applications. It's a general, empirically grounded account of sensemaking that goes significantly beyond the myths and puts forward some nonobvious, testable hypotheses about the process. When people try to make sense of events, they begin with some perspective, viewpoint, or framework - however minimal. For now, let's use a metaphor and call this a frame. We can express frames in various meaningful forms, including stories, maps, organizational diagrams, or scripts, and can use them in subsequent and parallel processes. Even though frames define what count as data, they themselves actually shape the data Furthermore, frames change as we acquire data. In other words, this is a two-way street: Frames shape and define the relevant data, and data mandate that frames change in nontrivial ways. We examine five areas of empirical findings: causal reasoning, commitment to hypotheses, feedback and learning, sense-making as a skill, and confirmation bias. In each area the Data/Frame model, and the research it's based on, doesn't align with common beliefs. For that reason, the Data/Frame model cannot be considered a depiction of commonsense views.},

Explaining these areas at a level and in a way that is not often found in other books on the topic, the authors present the basic theory behind contemporary machine learning and uniquely utilize its foundations as a framework for philosophical thinking about inductive inference. Promoting the fundamental goal of statistical learning, knowing what is achievable and what is not, this book demonstrates the value of a systematic methodology when used along with the needed techniques for evaluating the performance of a learning system. First, an introduction to machine learning is presented that includes brief discussions of applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, medical diagnostics, and statistical arbitrage. To enhance accessibility, two chapters on relevant aspects of probability theory are provided. Subsequent chapters feature coverage of topics such as the pattern recognition problem, optimal Bayes decision rule, the nearest neighbor rule, kernel rules, neural networks, support vector machines, and boosting. Appendices throughout the book explore the relationship between the discussed material and related topics from mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and statistics, drawing insightful connections between problems in these areas and statistical learning theory. All chapters conclude with a summary section, a set of practice questions, and a reference sections that supplies historical notes and additional resources for further study. An Elementary Introduction to Statistical Learning Theory is an excellent book for courses on statistical learning theory, pattern recognition, and machine learning at the upper-undergraduate and graduatelevels.

@book{carey2015learn,
  abstract = {
In the tradition of The Power of Habit and Thinking, Fast and Slow comes a practical, playful, and endlessly fascinating guide to what we really know about learning and memory today‚Äîand how we can apply it to our own lives.

From an early age, it is drilled into our heads: Restlessness, distraction, and ignorance are the enemies of success. We‚Äôre told that learning is all self-discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize that presentation, or nail that piano recital.

But what if almost everything we were told about learning is wrong? And what if there was a way to achieve more with less effort?

In How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your recall? Are there times when distraction is good? Is repetition necessary? Carey‚Äôs search for answers to these questions yields a wealth of strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday lives‚Äîand less of a chore.

By road testing many of the counterintuitive techniques described in this book, Carey shows how we can flex the neural muscles that make deep learning possible. Along the way he reveals why teachers should give final exams on the first day of class, why it is wise to interleave subjects and concepts when learning any new skill, and when it is smarter to stay up late prepping for that presentation than to rise early for one last cram session. And if this requires some suspension of disbelief, that‚Äôs because the research defies what we‚Äôve been told, throughout our lives, about how best to learn.

The brain is not like a muscle, at least not in any straightforward sense. It is something else altogether, sensitive to mood, to timing, to circadian rhythms, as well as to location and environment. It does not take orders well, to put it mildly. If the brain is a learning machine, then it is an eccentric one. In How We Learn, Benedict Carey shows us how to exploit its quirks to our advantage.

@article{carvalho2014effects,
  abstract = {Studying different concepts by frequently alternating between them (i.e., interleaving), improves discriminative contrast between different categories, while studying each concept in separate blocks emphasizes the similarities within each category. Interleaved study has been shown to improve learning of high similarity categories by increasing between-category comparison, while blocked study improves learning of low similarity categories by increasing within-category comparison.  In addition, interleaved study presents greater temporal spacing between repetitions of each category compared to blocked study, which might present long-term memory benefits. In this study we asked if the benefits of temporal spacing would interact with the benefits of sequencing for making comparisons when testing was delayed, particularly for low similarity categories. Blocked study might be predicted to promote noticing similarities across members of the same category and result in short-term benefits. However, the increase in temporal delay between repetitions inherent to interleaved study might benefit both types of categories when tested after a longer retention interval. Participants studied categories either interleaved or blocked and were tested immediately and 24 hours after study. We found an interaction between schedule of study and the type of category studied, which is consistent with the differential emphasis promoted by each sequential schedule. However, increasing the retention interval did not modulate this interaction or resulted in improved performance for interleaved study. Overall, this indicates that the benefit of interleaving is not primarily due to temporal spacing during study, but rather due to the cross-category comparisons that interleaving facilitates. We discuss the benefits of temporal spacing of repetitions in the context of sequential study and how it can be integrated with the attentional bias hypothesis proposed by Carvalho and Goldstone (2014).},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with automatic generation of all possible questions from a topic of interest. Specifically, we consider that each topic is associated with a body of texts containing useful information about the topic. Then, questions are generated by exploiting the named entity information and the predicate argument structures of the sentences present in the body of texts. The importance of the generated questions is measured using Latent Dirichlet Allocation by identifying the subtopics (which are closely related to the original topic) in the given body of texts and applying the Extended String Subsequence Kernel to calculate their similarity with the questions. We also propose the use of syntactic tree kernels for the automatic judgment of the syntactic correctness of the questions. The questions are ranked by considering both their importance (in the context of the given body of texts) and syntactic correctness. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has accomplished this task in our setting. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed topic-to-question generation approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art results.},

@article{karpicke2009metacognitive,
  abstract = {Basic research on human learning and memory has shown that practicing retrieval of information (by testing the information) has powerful effects on learning and long-term retention. Repeated testing enhances learning more than repeated reading, which often confers limited benefit beyond that gained from the initial reading of the material. Laboratory research also suggests that students lack metacognitive awareness of the mnemonic benefits of testing. The implication is that in real-world educational settings students may not engage in retrieval practise to enhance learning. To investigate students‚Äô real-world study behaviours, we surveyed 177 college students and asked them (1) to list strategies they used when studying (an open-ended free report question) and (2) to choose whether they would reread or practise recall after studying a textbook chapter (a forced report question). The results of both questions point to the same conclusion: A majority of students repeatedly read their notes or textbook (despite the limited benefits of this strategy), but relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practise while studying. We propose that many students experience illusions of competence while studying and that these illusions have significant consequences for the strategies students select when they monitor and regulate their own learning. },

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

In this work, we examined resting-state fMRI networks from 194 subjects at a voxel-level resolution, and examined the consistency of RSNs across subjects using a metric called scaled inclusivity (SI), which summarizes consistency of modular partitions across networks. Our SI analyses indicated that some RSNs are robust across subjects, comparable to the corresponding RSNs identified by ICA. We also found that some commonly reported RSNs are less consistent across subjects. This is the first direct comparison of RSNs between ICAs and graph-based network analyses at a comparable resolution.},

@article{pan2015interleaving,
  abstract = {Whereas blocking involves practicing one skill at a time before the next (for example, ‚Äúskill A‚Äù before ‚Äúskill B‚Äù and so on, forming the pattern ‚ÄúAAABBBCCC‚Äù), in interleaving one mixes, or interleaves, practice on several related skills together (forming for example the pattern ‚ÄúABCABCABC‚Äù). For instance, a pianist alternates practice between scales, chords, and arpeggios.  Credit: Thinkstock
We‚Äôve all heard the adage: practice makes perfect! In other words, acquiring skills takes time and effort. But how exactly does one go about learning a complex subject such as tennis, calculus, or even how to play the violin? An age-old answer is: practice one skill at a time. A beginning pianist might rehearse scales before chords. A young tennis player practices the forehand before the backhand. Learning researchers call this ‚Äúblocking,‚Äù and because it is commonsensical and easy to schedule, blocking is dominant in schools, training programs, and other settings.
However another strategy promises improved results. Enter ‚Äúinterleaving,‚Äù a largely unheard-of technique that is capturing the attention of cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists. Whereas blocking involves practicing one skill at a time before the next (for example, ‚Äúskill A‚Äù before ‚Äúskill B‚Äù and so on, forming the pattern ‚ÄúAAABBBCCC‚Äù), in interleaving one mixes, or interleaves, practice on several related skills together (forming for example the pattern ‚ÄúABCABCABC‚Äù). For instance, a pianist alternates practice between scales, chords, and arpeggios, while a tennis player alternates practice between forehands, backhands, and volleys.
Over the past four decades, a small but growing body of research has found that interleaving often outperforms blocking for a variety of subjects, including sports and category learning. Yet there have been almost no studies of the technique in uncontrived, real world settings‚Äîuntil recently. New research in schools finds that interleaving produces dramatic and long-lasting benefits for an essential skill: math. Not only does this finding have the potential to transform how math is taught, it may also change how people learn more generally.
The first signs of interleaving‚Äôs promise appeared in the domain of motor skills. One early study, published in 1986, involved training students to learn three types of badminton serves. Compared with blocking, interleaving produced better recall of each serve type and better ability to handle new situations, such as serving from the opposite side of the court. Similar results were later reported for baseball, basketball, and other sports. In 2003, one of the first studies to examine interleaving outside of sports found that using it to train medical students produced more accurate electrocardiogram diagnoses than blocking. In 2008, another widely-cited study found a similar benefit for teaching college students to recognize the painting styles of landscape artists. Even critical thinking skills benefit: in a 2011 study, students trained with the technique made more accurate assessments of complex legal scenarios.
Foreign language studies however suggest that the effectiveness of interleaving comes with an important caveat. When native English speakers used the technique to learn an entirely unfamiliar language, such as to generate English-to-Swahili translations, the results were better, the same, or worse than after blocking. These mixed results imply that learners should have some familiarity with subject materials before interleaving begins (or, the materials should be quickly or easily understood). Otherwise, as appears to be the case for foreign languages, interleaving can sometimes be more confusing than helpful.
Given interleaving‚Äôs promise, it is surprising then that few studies have investigated its utility in everyday applications. However, a new study by cognitive psychologist Doug Rohrer and colleagues at the University of South Florida, recently published in the Journal of Educational Psychology, takes a step towards addressing that gap. Rohrer and his team are the first to implement interleaving in actual classrooms. The location: middle schools in Tampa, Florida. The target skills: algebra and geometry.
The three-month study involved teaching 7th graders slope and graph problems. Weekly lessons, given by teachers, were largely unchanged from standard practice. Weekly homework worksheets, however, featured an interleaved or blocked design. When interleaved, both old and new problems of different types were mixed together. Of the nine participating classes, five used interleaving for slope problems and blocking for graph problems; the reverse occurred in the remaining four. Five days after the last lesson, each class held a review session for all students. A surprise final test occurred one day or one month later. The result? When the test was one day later, scores were 25 percent better for problems trained with interleaving; at one month later, the interleaving advantage grew to 76 percent.
These results are important for a host of reasons. First, they show that interleaving works in real-world, extended use. It is highly effective with an almost ubiquitous subject, math. The interleaving effect is long-term‚Äîlasting on the order of months‚Äîand the advantage over blocking actually increases with the passage of time (in other words, there‚Äôs less forgetting). The benefit even persists when blocked materials receive additional review. Overall, the interleaving effect can be strong, stable, and long-lasting.
Clearly interleaving does wonders for 7th grade math. Moreover, when combined with prior work showing similar benefits of the technique across a spectrum of topics (algebra, exponents, proportions, prisms, and volumes) and with students at different grade levels (elementary through college), interleaving may turn out to be among the most effective math learning techniques.
Researchers are now working to understand why interleaving yields such impressive results. One prominent explanation is that it improves the brain‚Äôs ability to tell apart, or discriminate, between concepts. With blocking, once you know what solution to use, or movement to execute, the hard part is over. With interleaving, each practice attempt is different from the last, so rote responses don‚Äôt work. Instead, your brain must continuously focus on searching for different solutions. That process can improve your ability to learn critical features of skills and concepts, which then better enables you to select and execute the correct response.
A second explanation is that interleaving strengthens memory associations. With blocking, a single strategy, temporarily held in short-term memory, is sufficient. That‚Äôs not the case with interleaving‚Äîthe correct solution changes from one practice attempt to the next. As a result, your brain is continually engaged at retrieving different responses and bringing them into short-term memory. Repeating that process can reinforce neural connections between different tasks and correct responses, which enhances learning.
Both of these accounts imply that increased effort during training, either to discriminate correct responses or to strengthen them, is needed when interleaving is used. This corresponds to a potential drawback of the technique, namely that the learning process often feels more gradual and difficult at the outset. However, that added effort can generate better, longer-lasting results.
In modern society there is tremendous interest in ways to enhance learning and memory: brain training, learning apps, and so on. Interleaving has the benefit of scientific evidence in favor of its use across a range of circumstances. It also has the practical advantage of requiring no extra training, extra time, or special equipment to work. Only more careful planning is required, and possibly some extra effort at the outset.
Despite these relative advantages, interleaving remains mostly unknown and unused. Consider the example of grade school math. Out of all the math textbooks used in the U.S. today, all but one type‚Äîthe Saxon series‚Äîuses blocked practice. One can only speculate on what would happen if interleaving were widely used in classrooms and in textbooks. The differences in academic achievement could be substantial.
As interleaving research progresses, we stand to learn much more about the technique: other areas where it works, or doesn‚Äôt, and what other limitations it might have. Yet that doesn‚Äôt preclude us from putting it to the test right now. For instance, are you studying statistics? Learning to play an instrument? Taking up a new sport? In all of these areas, you are faced with a series of skills or concepts to learn. The typical response would be to practice each of these, one at a time, over and over. Another option would be to mix it up. As it turns out, your brain may prefer doing exactly that.},

  abstract = {Mark Twain once observed, ‚ÄúA lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.‚Äù His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas‚Äìbusiness people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others‚Äìstruggle to make their ideas ‚Äústick.‚Äù

Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the ‚Äúhuman scale principle,‚Äù using the ‚ÄúVelcro Theory of Memory,‚Äù and creating ‚Äúcuriosity gaps.‚Äù

In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds‚Äìfrom the infamous ‚Äúkidney theft ring‚Äù hoax to a coach‚Äôs lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony‚Äìdraw their power from the same six traits.

Made to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It‚Äôs a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures)‚Äìthe Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of ‚Äúthe Mother Teresa Effect‚Äù; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas‚Äìand tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.

Brothers Chip and Dan Heath in their New York Time‚Äôs best-selling book, ‚ÄúMade to Stick,‚Äù explore the stickiness of an idea. Those of us who spend time in the start-up world marvel at why one idea gains traction and other, seemingly better ideas, fall to wayside. The Heath brothers provide insights on this phenomenon and provide help for those bent on creating ideas that are ‚Äústicky.‚Äù

‚ÄúSticky‚Äù ideas are understandable, memorable, and effective in changing thought or behavior. The six underlying SUCCESs principles for making things ‚Äústick‚Äù are:

‚Ä¢ Simplicity ‚Äì Simple=core+compact. Find and share your core idea; make it simple and profound. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the economy, stupid‚Äù (Clinton campaign, 1992) is a great example. The inverted pyramid approach which is used in journalism is a good tool to get your headline.
‚Ä¢ Unexpectedness - We need to violate people‚Äôs expectations to get them to pay attention. Break existing patterns to get people‚Äôs attention. Southwest flight attendants use humor (there are two doors on either side if you need to jump!) to hold attention when giving the pre-flight safety announcement. Humans adapt incredibly quickly to patterns. Consistent sensory stimulation makes us tune out.
‚Ä¢ Concreteness ‚Äì You must help people understand and remember. Don‚Äôt use abstractions. Make your core idea concrete. Use common knowledge to make your idea stick. Our greatest villain is the Curse of Knowledge or when we assume everyone knows what we know or shares our unique perspective. We have to see it from the ‚Äúothers‚Äù point of view. We forget what other people do not know and slip into ‚Äúabstractspeak.‚Äù Boeing‚Äôs criteria for a new plane was not ‚Äúthe best passenger plane in the world‚Äù but one that can seat 131 passengers and land on Runway 2-22 at LaGuardia. No ambiguity here.
‚Ä¢ Credibility ‚Äì Help people believe by making sure your idea carries its own credentials. Pass the ‚ÄúSinatra Test.‚Äù Examples offered include ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the Beef?‚Äù and Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúAre you better off today?‚Äù Both were credible and resonated as they were based on common shared knowledge.
‚Ä¢ Emotional‚Äì Make people care by using the power of association, appealing to self-interest, or identity. ‚ÄúPeople donate to Rokia more than a wide swath of Africa‚Äù; ‚ÄúHonoring the Game‚Äù versus the use of the word ‚Äòsportsmanship‚Äô; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in charge of morale‚Äù as stated by a US military cook in Iraq. We must make people feel something to get them to care. We are wired to feel things, not abstractions.
‚Ä¢ Stories ‚Äì Stories get people to act on our ideas. Stories act as a kind of mental flight simulator, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively. Stories are told and retold because they contain wisdom. The Healths provide what they view are the three basic story plots ‚Äì the Challenge Plot, The Connection Plot, and the Creativity Plot. Stories can almost single-handedly defeat ‚ÄúThe Curse of Knowledge.‚Äù I have been involved in a ministry for people in career-transition for over fifteen years. We consistently advise those in-transitions to create stories to highlight their skills and experience when interviewing. It is well understood that interviewers will mostly remember your comportment and more importantly, your stories.

A chapter is devoted to each principle with the authors providing context for clarity and understanding, examples, and tools to guide the development of a ‚Äústicky‚Äù idea.

The Curse of Knowledge is what escapes most when trying to pitch an idea. It is the natural psychological tendency that consistently gets in the way of our ability to successfully create ‚Äústicky ideas‚Äù using these principles. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know. This knowledge has ‚Äúcursed‚Äù us and makes it difficult to share our knowledge with others. It is because we cannot readily re-create our listeners state of mind. When a CEO discusses ‚Äúunlocking shareholder value,‚Äù there is a tune playing in his head that the employees can‚Äôt hear. On the other hand, President John F. Kennedy knew that opaque, abstract missions don‚Äôt captivate and inspire people so he concretely challenged the country with ‚Äúlanding on the moon by the end of the decade.‚Äù

Throughout the book, the authors present ‚ÄúIdea Clinics‚Äù which illustrate how an idea can be made stickier. Example: ‚ÄùDo smokers really need to understand the workings of the lungs in order to appreciate the dangers of smoking?‚Äù

The book itself is ‚Äústicky‚Äô filled with stories of normal people facing normal problems who did an amazing thing simply by applying these principles, even if they were not aware that they were doing this. They distinguish themselves by crafting ideas that made a difference.

Do your ideas gain traction and ‚ÄúStick‚Äù or are they cast aside for less important ideas? ‚ÄúMade to Stick‚Äù was written for you.},

Formal representation of knowledge has the advantage of being easy to reason with, but acquisition of structured knowledge in open domains from unstructured data is often difficult and expensive. Our central hypothesis is that shallow syntactic knowledge and its implied semantics can be easily acquired and can be used in many areas of a question-answering system. We take a two-stage approach to extract the syntactic knowledge and implied semantics. First, shallow knowledge from large collections of documents is automatically extracted. Second, additional semantics are inferred from aggregate statistics of the automatically extracted shallow knowledge. In this paper, we describe in detail what kind of shallow knowledge is extracted, how it is automatically done from a large corpus, and how additional semantics are inferred from aggregate statistics. We also briefly discuss the various ways extracted knowledge is used throughout the IBM DeepQA system.},

  abstract = {Research into how we learn has opened the door for utilizing cognitive theory to facilitate better student learning. But that's easier said than done. Many books about cognitive theory introduce radical but impractical theories, failing to make the connection to the classroom. In Small Teaching, James Lang presents a strategy for improving student learning with a series of modest but powerful changes that make a big difference--many of which can be put into practice in a single class period. These strategies are designed to bridge the chasm between primary research and the classroom environment in a way that can be implemented by any faculty in any discipline, and even integrated into pre-existing teaching techniques. Learn, for example: How does one become good at retrieving knowledge from memory? How does making predictions now help us learn in the future? How do instructors instill fixed or growth mindsets in their students? Each chapter introduces a basic concept in cognitive theory, explains when and how it should be employed, and provides firm examples of how the intervention has been or could be used in a variety of disciplines. Small teaching techniques include brief classroom or online learning activities, one-time interventions, and small modifications in course design or communication with students.
Cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists, and biologists all have produced a revealing body of research over the past several decades on how human beings learn, but often translating these findings into the classroom is overwhelming for busy instructors. Small Teaching bridges the gap between research and practice by providing a fully developed strategy for making deliberate, structured, and incremental steps towards tuning into how your students are hardwired to learn.

Developed by a global authority on teaching and learning, the practice of "small teaching" enables every type of educator in all disciplines to energize and boost student understanding by introducing small activities that require minimal preparation and grading. The models inside are specifically designed to be used as both one-time experiences to innovate a course session or unit plan as well as a menu of options that can be combined into an entirely new teaching approach. Each chapter gives examples of how a particular learning phenomenon appears in everyday life, supporting research and findings, up to five small-teaching models, guidance for customizing your own models, and quick-reference features when you need inspiration fifteen minutes before class. Small teaching techniques include brief classroom or online learning activities, one-time interventions, and small modifications in course design or communication with students that let you:

Capture or recapture the students' attention, provide quick opportunities for student engagement, and introduce or wrap up new learning
Deepen student understanding of material and expand their ability to analyze and improve their own learning
Give students the tools, techniques, and principles to effectively practice a range of cognitive skills
Small Teaching gives you all the know-how and how-to for making big improvements to your learning environment.},

@article{roediger2012inexpensive,
  abstract = {The need to improve the educational system has never been greater. People in congress and business argue for expensive technological applications to improve education despite a lack of empirical evidence for their efficacy. We argue that one inexpensive avenue for improving education has been largely ignored. Cognitive and educational psychologists have identified strategies that greatly improve learning and retention of information, and yet these techniques are not generally applied in education nor taught in education schools. In fact, teachers often use instructional practices known to be wrong (i.e., massing rather than interleaving examples to explain a topic). We identify three general principles that are inexpensive to implement and have been shown in both laboratory and field experiments to improve learning: (1) distribution (spacing and interleaving) of practice in learning facts and skills; (2) retrieval practice (via self testing) for durable learning; and (3) explanatory questioning (elaborative interrogation and self-explanation) as a study strategy. We describe each technique, provide supporting evidence, and discuss classroom applications. Each principle can be applied to most subject matters from kindergarten to higher education. Applying findings from cognitive psychology to classroom instruction is no panacea for educational problems, but it represents one helpful and inexpensive strategy.

Many advocate the use of expensive high tech tools to promote student learning, but these have not been empirically validated. ‚ø∫ Three principles from cognitive psychology (spacing, testing, explanatory questioning) effectively enhance long-term learning. ‚ø∫ These principles can be incorporated into classroom instruction and study routines at little or no financial cost.},

‚ÄúMany an earnest student, after repeated failures, assumes a sort of hopeless, discouraged attitude of mind, which naturally leads him into the habit of trying to learn his lessons by memorizing in the hope of being able to pass, if only by scraping through, and into other bad habits which have been referred to in the foregoing pages. Such an attitude of mind should be resolutely opposed, and the teacher, even when severely correcting a student, should encourage him to see the possibilities that are within his reach if he will exercise his will and put forth his utmost powers in a proper manner. Success in the work of the world depends much more upon will than upon brains; but all faculties, whether mental or moral, can be cultivated and developed to an almost unlimited extent. A study of the biographies of men who have succeeded should be urged upon the student, and such a study will show how often success has been attained only after repeated failures. It is scarcely too much to say to a student that he can attain anything he desires, if he desires it with sufficient intensity; that is to say, if he possesses sufficient will power, and if he will train himself to direct his efforts properly.‚Äù

This book has a philosophical view about learning. It takes many principles about how we develop our understanding in any subject. As a student, I could say that it provides essential insights as well as advises.

There is a world of difference between being a good student (getting good grades) and being a good learner (actually retaining information and being a more intelligent person). This book provides insight into the difference, and gives great instructions on how to really study and learn mindfulness when presented with information. The copyright on this is from 1917. It is 95 years old, and still 100% applicable to students today.

@article{taylor2010effects,
  abstract = {Previous research shows that interleaving rather than blocking practice of different skills (e.g. abcbcacab instead of aaabbbccc) usually improves subsequent test performance. Yet interleaving, but not blocking, ensures that practice of any particular skill is distributed, or spaced, because any two opportunities to practice the same task are not consecutive. Hence, because spaced practice typically improves test performance, the previously observed test benefits of interleaving may be due to spacing rather than interleaving per se. In the experiment reported herein, children practiced four kinds of mathematics problems in an order that was interleaved or blocked, and the degree of spacing was fixed. The interleaving of practice impaired practice session performance yet doubled scores on a test given one day later. An analysis of the errors suggested that interleaving boosted test scores by improving participants' ability to pair each problem with the appropriate procedure.

Traditionally, question generation (QG) systems apply syntactical transformation on individual sentences to generate open domain questions. We hypothesize that a QG system informed by domain knowledge can ask more important questions. To this end, we propose two lightly-supervised methods to select salient target concepts for QG based on domain knowledge collected from a corpus. One method selects important semantic roles with bootstrapping and the other selects important semantic relations with Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed methods on heterogeneous corpora in the business domain. Both methods lead to systems that ask more important and more grammatical questions.

@article{guida2012chunks,
  abstract = {Our review of research on PET and fMRI neuroimaging of experts and expertise acquisition reveals two apparently discordant patterns in working-memory-related tasks. When experts are involved, studies show activations in brain regions typically activated during long-term memory tasks that are not observed with novices, a result that is compatible with functional brain reorganization. By contrast, when involving novices and training programs, studies show a decrease in brain regions typically activated during working memory tasks, with no functional reorganization. We suggest that the latter result is a consequence of practice periods that do not allow important structures to be completely acquired: knowledge structures (i.e., Ericsson and Kintsch's retrieval structures; Gobet and Simon's templates) and in a lesser way, chunks. These structures allow individuals to improve performance on working-memory tasks, by enabling them to use part of long-term memory as working memory, causing a cerebral functional reorganization. Our hypothesis is that the two brain activation patterns observed in the literature are not discordant, but involve the same process of expertise acquisition in two stages: from decreased activation to brain functional reorganization. The dynamic of these two physiological stages depend on the two above-mentioned psychological constructs: chunks and knowledge structures.},

The primary obstacle is a conflict that‚Äôs built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems‚Äîthe rational mind and the emotional mind‚Äîthat compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort‚Äîbut if it is overcome, change can come quickly.

In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people‚Äîemployees and managers, parents and nurses‚Äîhave united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:
‚óè      The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients.
‚óè      The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping.
‚óè      The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service

In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, },

  abstract = {The literature on testing effects is vast but supports surprisingly few prescriptive conclusions for how to schedule practice to achieve both durable and efficient learning. Key limitations are that few studies have examined the effects of initial learning criterion or the effects of relearning, and no prior research has examined the combined effects of these 2 factors. Across 3 experiments, 533 students learned conceptual material via retrieval practice with restudy. Items were practiced until they were correctly recalled from 1 to 4 times during an initial learning session and were then practiced again to 1 correct recall in 1‚Äì5 subsequent relearning sessions (across experiments, more than 100,000 short-answer recall responses were collected and hand-scored). Durability was measured by cued recall and rate of relearning 1‚Äì4 months after practice, and efficiency was measured by total practice trials across sessions. A consistent qualitative pattern emerged: The effects of initial learning criterion and relearning were subadditive, such that the effects of initial learning criterion were strong prior to relearning but then diminished as relearning increased. Relearning had pronounced effects on long-term retention with a relatively minimal cost in terms of additional practice trials. On the basis of the overall patterns of durability and efficiency, our prescriptive conclusion for students is to practice recalling concepts to an initial criterion of 3 correct recalls and then to relearn them 3 times at widely spaced intervals.

  abstract = {First released in the Spring of 1999, How People Learn has been expanded to show how the theories and insights from the original book can translate into actions and practice, now making a real connection between classroom activities and learning behavior. This edition includes far-reaching suggestions for research that could increase the impact that classroom teaching has on actual learning.

Like the original edition, this book offers exciting new research about the mind and the brain that provides answers to a number of compelling questions. When do infants begin to learn? How do experts learn and how is this different from non-experts? What can teachers and schools do-with curricula, classroom settings, and teaching methods--to help children learn most effectively? New evidence from many branches of science has significantly added to our understanding of what it means to know, from the neural processes that occur during learning to the influence of culture on what people see and absorb.

How People Learn examines these findings and their implications for what we teach, how we teach it, and how we assess what our children learn. The book uses exemplary teaching to illustrate how approaches based on what we now know result in in-depth learning. This new knowledge calls into question concepts and practices firmly entrenched in our current education system.

Topics include:

How learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain.
How existing knowledge affects what people notice and how they learn.
What the thought processes of experts tell us about how to teach.
The amazing learning potential of infants.
The relationship of classroom learning and everyday settings of community and workplace.
Learning needs and opportunities for teachers.
A realistic look at the role of technology in education.},

A pattern matching phase is applied for selecting the best matching question pattern for the test sentence. The proposed model is tested against a set of sentences obtained from many sources such as the TREC 2007 dataset for question answering, Wikipedia articles, and English book of grade II preparatory.

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. The second edition of Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra.

@inproceedings{binnig2007qagen,
  abstract = {Today, a common methodology for testing a database management system (DBMS) is to generate a set of test databases and then execute queries on top of them. However, for DBMS testing, it would be a big advantage if we can control the input and/or the output (e.g., the cardinality) of each individual operator of a test query for a particular test case. Unfortunately, current database generators generate databases independent of queries. As a result, it is hard to guarantee that executing the test query on the generated test databases can obtain the desired (intermediate) query results that match the test case. In this paper, we propose a novel way for DBMS testing. Instead of first generating a test database and then seeing how well it matches a particular test case (or otherwise use a trial-and-error approach to generate another test database), we propose to generate a query-aware database for each test case. To that end, we designed a query-aware test database generator called QAGen. In addition to the database schema and the set of basic constraints defined on the base tables, QAGen takes the query and the set of constraints defined on the query as input, and generates a query-aware test database as output. The generated database guarantees that the test query can get the desired (intermediate) query results as defined in the test case. This approach of testing facilitates a wide range of DBMS testing tasks such as testing of memory managers and testing the cardinality estimation components of query optimizers.},

SYSTEMATIC is the first book to introduce general readers to systems biology, which is improving medical treatments and our understanding of living things. In traditional bottom-up biology, a biologist might spend years studying how a single protein works, but systems biology studies how networks of those proteins work together--how they promote health and how to remedy the situation when the system isn't functioning properly.

Breakthroughs in systems biology became possible only when powerful computer technology enabled researchers to process massive amounts of data to study complete systems, and has led to progress in the study of gene regulation and inheritance, cancer drugs personalized to an individual's genetically unique tumor, insights into how the brain works, and the discovery that the bacteria and other microbes that live in the gut may drive malnutrition and obesity. Systems biology is allowing us to understand more complex phenomena than ever before.

@book{mcguire2015teaching,
  abstract = {"It shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that a volume intent on teaching students how to learn is just as intent on teaching the reader how to do just that, but it is still refreshing to read a book that lays out its goals, sticks to the promises it makes, and even creates its own study guide based on how much time the reader has to give to the text. Well-structured and clear, Saundra Yancy McGuire‚Äôs Teach Students How to Learn is as thoughtful about itself as it is about the content it presents. McGuire has composed this book to reflect her own response to and engagement with a pressing problem in higher education: namely, that many students, even those who qualify for admission at prestigious institutions, arrive without ever having been taught to learn by anything but rote memorization. Faced with college‚Äôs demands of skills higher in Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy, they find themselves struggling and even failing.

With this book McGuire gives teachers the tools they need to move their students past the high school model of retention until regurgitation, helping them instead to internalize a more nuanced, flexible understanding of learning. To convey this understanding, McGuire focuses on student mindset, encouraging educators to bring in everything from neurobiological models to fellow student success stories in order to help learners see that they are not stuck being 'bad' at something ‚Äì that change is not only possible, but already well within reach.

Most of all, McGuire is a fun writer. Personal and plainspoken, her style makes the pages fly by. (Any worries that this book might drown the reader in jargon should be alleviated by the appearance of the words ‚Äòmetacognition, schmetacognition‚Äô. I would recommend this book in particular to educators working with students from underserved communities, as giving students access to these techniques will help ensure their success far beyond the boundaries of a single classroom.‚Äù (Reflective Teaching (Wabash Center))

"I just wanted to write you a quick note to talk about how much I enjoyed your book Teach Students How to Learn. I work as the Associate Director for Teaching and Learning at the Faculty Center at my university. Every year I get to put on a Summer Teaching Institute for faculty. The theme that came out of much of the work we have been doing about High-Impact Practices and what we want to accomplish at the university centered on life-long learning and nurturing autonomy and agency in students. I wanted to make that the theme of the institute this year and in looking for materials I came across your book. I loved it and it is the book we are going to cover this summer. I think it will provide a wonderful road map for us as we try move past how best to teach information to our students into helping our students become better learners." (Matthew C.

‚ÄúDr. McGuire‚Äôs book, Teach Students How to Learn: Strategies You Can Incorporate into Any Course to Improve Student Metacognition, Study Skills, and Motivation, is a must read for faculty, staff, students, and top administrators.

It is both a consolidation of the research surrounding metacognition, mindset, and motivation and a how-to guide for putting that research into practice. (Improve with Metacognition)

‚ÄúIf you are already convinced ‚Äì or are at least willing to consider the possibility ‚Äì that your students could learn more deeply and achieve more success than they are at present, this book is for you. If you are frustrated by students who seem unmotivated and disengaged, this book is for you. If you find it challenging to teach underprepared students, this book is for you. And if you care about educational equity and fairness, this book is for you.

The not-so-familiar good news is that these same students can both survive and thrive in higher education. The message from relevant research is quite clear: What students do in college matters more than who they are or which institution they attend. What these underprepared students need most to do is to learn how to learn.

In this book, Saundra McGuire provides specific, practical, research-based strategies to teach students how to learn, focusing on the three key M‚Äôs ‚Äì mindset, motivation, and metacognition.

The book offers a broad range of strategies for teachers and for students, along with a wealth of examples, illustrations, and resources.‚Äù (Thomas A. Angelo, Clinical Professor of Educational Innovation & Research, The Division of Practice Advancement and Clinical Education and Director of Educator Development, Eshelman School of Pharmacy)

"This book is a wonderful resource for college faculty. It provides us with practical, yet powerful learning strategies and metacognition techniques that can be easily incorporated into our courses, and which in turn, will improve student learning. Dr. McGuire shares both research and her personal experiences, as well as her expertise in teaching all kinds of diverse students with tremendous success. This book is a welcome addition for the post secondary teaching and learning field and should be read and utilized by all." (Kathleen F. Gabriel, Associate Professor, School of Education)

"Teachers need to learn as much as their students. In a masterly and spirited exposition, spangled with wit and exhortation, rife with pragmatic strategies, Saundra McGuire teaches teachers how to awake in their students the powers dormant in them. Be aware, and you will learn!" (Roald Hoffmann, 1981 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry)

"An electrifying book! McGuire demonstrates how learning strategies can improve learning‚Äïand then charges faculty to teach them, complete with the slides for doing so in your class. . . A must read‚Äïand must do‚Äïfor every teacher who struggles with students who don‚Äôt learn as much as they could or should!" (Tara Gray, Ph.D., Director)

‚ÄúDr. McGuire's specific strategies serve me as paradigms I can adapt for my literature courses. Many of the specific exercises McGuire uses to illustrate metacognition quickly convinced my students that cognitive functions such as pattern recognition effectively guide the close reading of a text while taking time to overview a text and place it in context helps more advanced students take on the challenges of literary theory. The strategies outlined here take away the mystery, not the magic, of writing about literature.‚Äù (Helen Whall, Professor of English and Director of Comprehensive Academic Advising)

‚ÄúBased on solid scientific theory and real classroom case studies, Dr. McGuire‚Äôs workshop on Metacognition provides the participants with sound pedagogical advice and an impressive array of ready-to-use, result oriented teaching techniques for a 21st century classroom. With a metacognitive approach to teaching and learning, everything comes together.‚Äù (Irina Ivliyeva, Associate Professor of Russian)

‚ÄúI believe The Study Cycle handout was particularly useful because it provided a helpful step-by-step approach for students to learn the material in a class more effectively. Moreover, it is a good way to place the accountability for student success where it belongs‚Äïon the shoulders of the students (with professors providing guidance and support for their learning).‚Äù (Larry Gragg, Curators‚Äô Teaching Professor and Chair, Department of History and Political Science)},

@article{alyahya2014ontologybased,
  abstract = {With recent advancements in Semantic Web technologies, a new trend in MCQ item generation has emerged through the use of ontologies. Ontologies are knowledge representation structures that formally describe entities in a domain and their relationships, thus enabling automated inference and reasoning. Ontology-based MCQ item generation is still in its infancy, but substantial research efforts are being made in the field. However, the applicability of these models for use in an educational setting has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of an ontology-based MCQ item generation system known as OntoQue. The evaluation was conducted using two different domain ontologies. The findings of this study show that ontology-based MCQ generation systems produce satisfactory MCQ items to a certain extent. However, the evaluation also revealed a number of shortcomings with current ontology-based MCQ item generation systems with regard to the educational significance of an automatically constructed MCQ item, the knowledge level it addresses, and its language structure. Furthermore, for the task to be successful in producing high-quality MCQ items for learning assessments, this study suggests a novel, holistic view that incorporates learning content, learning objectives, lexical knowledge, and scenarios into a single cohesive framework.},

@article{rohrer2014benefit,
  abstract = {Most mathematics assignments consist of a group of problems requiring the same strategy. For example, a lesson on the quadratic formula is typically followed by a block of problems requiring students to use that formula, which means that students know the appropriate strategy before they read each problem. In an alternative approach, different kinds of problems appear in an interleaved order, which requires students to choose the strategy on the basis of the problem itself. In the classroom-based experiment reported here, grade 7 students (n = 140) received blocked or interleaved practice over a nine-week period, followed two weeks later by an unannounced test. The mean test scores were greater for material learned by interleaved practice rather than by blocked practice (72 {\%} vs. 38 {\%}, d = 1.05). This interleaving effect was observed even though the different kinds of problems were superficially dissimilar from each other, whereas previous interleaved mathematics studies had required students to learn nearly identical kinds of problems. We conclude that interleaving improves mathematics learning not only by improving discrimination between different kinds of problems, but also by strengthening the association between each kind of problem and its corresponding strategy.},

We were surprised to find that spacing facilitated both inductive and repetition learning by both young and older adults, even though the participants rated massing superior to spacing for inductive learning.

Learning is typically identified with the encoding or construction of knowledge, and retrieval is considered merely the assessment of learning that occurred in a prior experience. The retrieval-based learning perspective outlined here is grounded in the fact that all expressions of knowledge involve retrieval and depend on the retrieval cues available in a given context. Further, every time a person retrieves knowledge, that knowledge is changed, because retrieving knowledge improves one‚Äôs ability to retrieve it again in the future. Practicing retrieval does not merely produce rote, transient learning; it produces meaningful, long-term learning. Yet retrieval practice is a tool many students lack metacognitive awareness of and do not use as often as they should.

They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, & Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge.

@article{liu2012gasks,
  abstract = {Many electronic feedback systems have been proposed for writing support. However, most of these systems only aim at supporting writing to communicate instead of writing to learn, as in the case of literature review writing. Trigger questions are potentially forms of support for writing to learn, but current automatic question generation approaches focus on factual question generation for reading comprehension or vocabulary assessment. This article presents a novel Automatic Question Generation (AQG) system, called G-Asks, which generates specific trigger questions as a form of support for students' learning through writing. We conducted a large-scale case study, including 24 human supervisors and 33 research students, in an Engineering Research Method course and compared questions generated by G-Asks with human generated questions. The results indicate that G-Asks can generate questions as useful as human supervisors ('useful' is one of five question quality measures) while significantly outperforming Human Peer and Generic Questions in most quality measures after filtering out questions with grammatical and semantic errors. Furthermore, we identified the most frequent question types, derived from the human supervisors' questions and discussed how the human supervisors generate such questions from the source text.},

@book{geary2007origin,
  abstract = {Darwin considered an understanding of the evolution of the human mind and brain to be of major importance to the evolutionary sciences. This groundbreaking book sets out a comprehensive, integrated theory of why and how the human mind has developed to function as it does. Geary proposes that human motivational, affective, behavioral, and cognitive systems have evolved to process social and ecological information (e.g., facial expressions) that covaried with survival or reproductive options during human evolution. Further, he argues that the ultimate focus of all of these systems is to support our attempts to gain access to and control of resources - more specifically, the social (e.g., mates), biological (e.g., food), and physical (e.g., territory) resources that supported successful survival and reproduction over time. In this view, Darwin's conceptualization of natural selection as a struggle for existence becomes, for us, a struggle with other human beings for control of the available resources. This struggle provides a means of integrating modular brain and cognitive systems such as language with those brain and cognitive systems that support general intelligence. findings in cognitive science and neuroscience as well as primatology, anthropology, and sociology. The book also explores a number of issues that are of interest in modern society, including how general intelligence relates to academic achievement, occupational status, and income. Readers will find this book a thought-provoking read and an impetus for new theories of mind.},

@article{paul2015researchers,
  abstract = {Too often school assessments heighten anxiety and hinder learning. New research shows how to reverse the trend.

Since the enactment of No Child Left Behind in 2002, parents' and teachers' opposition to the law's mandate to test ‚Äúevery child, every year‚Äù in grades three through eight has been intensifying.
Critics charge that the high-stakes assessments inflict anxiety on students and teachers, turning classrooms into test-preparation factories instead of laboratories of meaningful learning.
Research in cognitive science and psychology shows that testing, done right, can be an effective way to learn. Taking tests can produce better recall of facts and a deeper understanding than an education devoid of exams.
Tests being developed to assess how well students have met the Common Core State Standards show promise as evaluations of deep learning.
In schools across the U.S., multiple-choice questions such as this one provoke anxiety, even dread. Their appearance means it is testing time, and tests are big, important, excruciatingly unpleasant events.
But not at Columbia Middle School in Illinois, in the classroom of eighth grade history teacher Patrice Bain. Bain has lively blue eyes, a quick smile, and spiky platinum hair that looks punkish and pixieish at the same time. After displaying the question on a smartboard, she pauses as her students enter their responses on numbered devices known as clickers.
‚ÄúOkay, has everyone put in their answers?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúNumber 19, we're waiting on you!‚Äù Hurriedly, 19 punches in a selection, and together Bain and her students look over the class's responses, now displayed at the bottom of the smartboard screen. ‚ÄúMost of you got it‚ÄîJohn Glenn‚Äîvery nice.‚Äù She chuckles and shakes her head at the answer three of her students have submitted. ‚ÄúOh, my darlings,‚Äù says Bain in playful reproach. ‚ÄúKhrushchev was not an astronaut!‚Äù
Bain moves on to the next question, briskly repeating the process of asking, answering and explaining as she and her students work through the decade of the 1960s.
When every student gives the correct answer, the class members raise their hands and wiggle their fingers in unison, an exuberant gesture they call ‚Äúspirit fingers.‚Äù This is the case with the Bay of Pigs question: every student nails it.
‚ÄúAll right!‚Äù Bain enthuses. ‚ÄúThat's our fifth spirit fingers today!‚Äù
The banter in Bain's classroom is a world away from the tense standoffs at public schools around the country. Since the enactment of No Child Left Behind in 2002, parents' and teachers' opposition to the law's mandate to test ‚Äúevery child, every year‚Äù in grades three through eight has been intensifying. A growing number of parents are withdrawing their children from the annual state tests; the epicenter of the ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù movement may be New York State, where as many as 90 percent of students in some districts reportedly refused to take the year-end examination last spring. Critics of U.S. schools' heavy emphasis on testing charge that the high-stakes assessments inflict anxiety on students and teachers, turning classrooms into test-preparation factories instead of laboratories of genuine, meaningful learning.
In the always polarizing debate over how American students should be educated, testing has become the most controversial issue of all. Yet a crucial piece has been largely missing from the discussion so far. Research in cognitive science and psychology shows that testing, done right, can be an exceptionally effective way to learn. Taking tests, as well as engaging in well-designed activities before and after tests, can produce better recall of facts‚Äîand deeper and more complex understanding‚Äîthan an education without exams. But a testing regime that actively supports learning, in addition to simply assessing, would look very different from the way American schools ‚Äúdo‚Äù testing today.
What Bain is doing in her classroom is called retrieval practice. The practice has a well-established base of empirical support in the academic literature, going back almost 100 years‚Äîbut Bain, unaware of this research, worked out something very similar on her own over the course of a 21-year career in the classroom.
‚ÄúI've been told I'm a wonderful teacher, which is nice to hear, but at the same time I feel the need to tell people: ‚ÄòNo, it's not me‚Äîit's the method,‚Äô‚Äù says Bain in an interview after her class has ended. ‚ÄúI felt my way into this approach, and I've seen it work such wonders that I want to get up on a mountaintop and shout so everyone can hear me: ‚ÄòYou should be doing this, too!‚Äô But it's been hard to persuade other teachers to try it.‚Äù
Then, eight years ago, she met Mark McDaniel through a mutual acquaintance. McDaniel is a psychology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, a half an hour's drive from Bain's school. McDaniel had started to describe to Bain his research on retrieval practice when she broke in with an exclamation. ‚ÄúPatrice said, ‚ÄòI do that in my classroom! It works!‚Äô‚Äù McDaniel recalls. He went on to explain to Bain that what he and his colleagues refer to as retrieval practice is, essentially, testing. ‚ÄúWe used to call it ‚Äòthe testing effect‚Äô until we got smart and realized that no teacher or parent would want to touch a technique that had the word ‚Äòtest‚Äô in it,‚Äù McDaniel notes now.
Retrieval practice does not use testing as a tool of assessment. Rather it treats tests as occasions for learning, which makes sense only once we recognize that we have misunderstood the nature of testing. We think of tests as a kind of dipstick that we insert into a student's head, an indicator that tells us how high the level of knowledge has risen in there‚Äîwhen in fact, every time a student calls up knowledge from memory, that memory changes. Its mental representation becomes stronger, more stable and more accessible.
Why would this be? It makes sense considering that we could not possibly remember everything we encounter, says Jeffrey Karpicke, a professor of cognitive psychology at Purdue University. Given that our memory is necessarily selective, the usefulness of a fact or idea‚Äîas demonstrated by how often we have had reason to recall it‚Äîmakes a sound basis for selection. ‚ÄúOur minds are sensitive to the likelihood that we'll need knowledge at a future time, and if we retrieve a piece of information now, there's a good chance we'll need it again,‚Äù Karpicke explains. ‚ÄúThe process of retrieving a memory alters that memory in anticipation of demands we may encounter in the future.‚Äù
Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain are beginning to reveal the neural mechanisms behind the testing effect. In the handful of studies that have been conducted so far, scientists have found that calling up information from memory, as compared with simply restudying it, produces higher levels of activity in particular areas of the brain. These brain regions are associated with the so-called consolidation, or stabilization, of memories and with the generation of cues that make memories readily accessible later on. Across several studies, researchers have demonstrated that the more active these regions are during an initial learning session, the more successful is study participants' recall weeks or months later.
According to Karpicke, retrieving is the principal way learning happens. ‚ÄúRecalling information we've already stored in memory is a more powerful learning event than storing that information in the first place,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúRetrieval is ultimately the process that makes new memories stick.‚Äù Not only does retrieval practice help students remember the specific information they retrieved, it also improves retention for related information that was not directly tested. Researchers theorize that while sifting through our mind for the particular piece of information we are trying to recollect, we call up associated memories and in so doing strengthen them as well. Retrieval practice also helps to prevent students from confusing the material they are currently learning with material they learned previously and even appears to prepare students' minds to absorb the material still more thoroughly when they encounter it again after testing (a phenomenon researchers call ‚Äútest-potentiated learning‚Äù).
Hundreds of studies have demonstrated that retrieval practice is better at improving retention than just about any other method learners could use. To cite one example: in a study published in 2008 by Karpicke and his mentor, Henry Roediger III of Washington University, the authors reported that students who quizzed themselves on vocabulary terms remembered 80 percent of the words later on, whereas students who studied the words by repeatedly reading them over remembered only about a third of the words. Retrieval practice is especially powerful compared with students' most favored study strategies: highlighting and rereading their notes and textbooks, practices that a recent review found to be among the least effective.
And testing does not merely enhance the recall of isolated facts. The process of pulling up information from memory also fosters what researchers call deep learning. Students engaging in deep learning are able to draw inferences from, and make connections among, the facts they know and are able to apply their knowledge in varied contexts (a process learning scientists refer to as transfer). In an article published in 2011 in the journal Science, Karpicke and his Purdue colleague Janell Blunt explicitly compared retrieval practice with a study technique known as concept mapping. An activity favored by many teachers as a way to promote deep learning, concept mapping asks students to draw a diagram that depicts the body of knowledge they are learning, with the relations among concepts represented by links among nodes, like roads linking cities on a map.
In their study, Karpicke and Blunt directed groups of undergraduate volunteers‚Äî200 in all‚Äîto read a passage taken from a science textbook. One group was then asked to create a concept map while referring to the text; another group was asked to recall, from memory, as much information as they could from the text they had just read. On a test given to all the students a week later, the retrieval-practice group was better able to recall the concepts presented in the text than the concept-mapping group. More striking, the former group was also better able to draw inferences and make connections among multiple concepts contained in the text. Overall, Karpicke and Blunt concluded, retrieval practice was about 50 percent more effective at promoting both factual and deep learning.
Transfer‚Äîthe ability to take knowledge learned in one context and apply it to another‚Äîis the ultimate goal of deep learning. In an article published in 2010 University of Texas at Austin psychologist Andrew Butler demonstrated that retrieval practice promotes transfer better than the conventional approach of studying by rereading. In Butler's experiment, students engaged either in rereading or in retrieval practice after reading a text that pertained to one ‚Äúknowledge domain‚Äù‚Äîin this case, bats' use of sound waves to find their way around. A week later the students were asked to transfer what they had learned about bats to a second knowledge domain: the navigational use of sound waves by submarines. Students who had quizzed themselves on the original text about bats were better able to transfer their bat learning to submarines.
Robust though such findings are, they were until recently almost exclusively made in the laboratory, with college students as subjects. McDaniel had long wanted to apply retrieval practice in real-world schools, but gaining access to K‚Äì12 classrooms was a challenge. With Bain's help, McDaniel and two of his Washington University colleagues, Roediger and Kathleen McDermott, set up a randomized controlled trial at Columbia Middle School that ultimately involved nine teachers and more than 1,400 students. During the course of the experiment, sixth, seventh and eighth graders learned about science and social studies in one of two ways: 1) material was presented once, then teachers reviewed it with students three times; 2) material was presented once, and students were quizzed on it three times (using clickers like the ones in Bain's current classroom).
When the results of students' regular unit tests were calculated, the difference between the two approaches was clear: students earned an average grade of C+ on material that had been reviewed and A‚àí on material that had been quizzed. On a follow-up test administered eight months later, students still remembered the information they had been quizzed on much better than the information they had reviewed.
‚ÄúI had always thought of tests as a way to assess‚Äînot as a way to learn‚Äîso initially I was skeptical,‚Äù says Andria Matzenbacher, a former teacher at Columbia who now works as an instructional designer. ‚ÄúBut I was blown away by the difference retrieval practice made in the students' performance.‚Äù Bain, for one, was not surprised. ‚ÄúI knew that this method works, but it was good to see it proven scientifically,‚Äù she says. McDaniel, Roediger and McDermott eventually extended the study to nearby Columbia High School, where quizzing generated similarly impressive results. In an effort to make retrieval practice a common strategy in classrooms across the country, the Washington University team (with the help of research associate Pooja K. Agarwal, now at Harvard University) developed a manual for teachers, How to Use Retrieval Practice to Improve Learning.
Even with the weight of evidence behind them, however, advocates of retrieval practice must still contend with a reflexively negative reaction to testing among many teachers and parents. They also encounter a more thoughtful objection, which goes something like this: American students are tested so much already‚Äîfar more often than students in other countries, such as Finland and Singapore, which regularly place well ahead of the U.S. in international evaluations. If testing is such a great way to learn, why aren't our students doing better?
Marsha Lovett has a ready answer to that question. Lovett, director of the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, is an expert on ‚Äúmetacognition‚Äù‚Äîthe capacity to think about our own learning, to be aware of what we know and do not know, and to use that awareness to effectively manage the learning process.
Yes, Lovett says, American students take a lot of tests. It is what happens afterward‚Äîor more precisely, what does not happen‚Äîthat causes these tests to fail to function as learning opportunities. Students often receive little information about what they got right and what they got wrong. ‚ÄúThat kind of item-by-item feedback is essential to learning, and we're throwing that learning opportunity away,‚Äù she says. In addition, students are rarely prompted to reflect in a big-picture way on their preparation for, and performance on, the test. ‚ÄúOften students just glance at the grade and then stuff the test away somewhere and never look at it again,‚Äù Lovett says. ‚ÄúAgain, that's a really important learning opportunity that we're letting go to waste.‚Äù
A few years ago Lovett came up with a way to get students to engage in reflection after a test. She calls it an ‚Äúexam wrapper.‚Äù When the instructor hands back a graded test to a student, along with it comes a piece of paper literally wrapped around the test itself. On this paper is a list of questions: a short exercise that students are expected to complete and hand in. The wrapper that Lovett designed for a math exam includes such questions as:
Based on the estimates above, what will you do differently in preparing for the next test? For example, will you change your study habits or try to sharpen specific skills? Please be specific. Also, what can we do to help?
The idea, Lovett says, is to get students thinking about what they did not know or did not understand, why they failed to grasp this information and how they could prepare more effectively in advance of the next test. Lovett has been promoting the use of exam wrappers to the Carnegie Mellon faculty for several years now, and a number of professors, especially in the sciences, have incorporated the technique into their courses. They hand out exam wrappers with graded exams, collect the wrappers once they are completed, and‚Äîcleverest of all‚Äîthey hand back the wrappers at the time when students are preparing for the next test.
Does this practice make a difference? In 2013 Lovett published a study of exam wrappers as a chapter in the edited volume Using Reflection and Metacognition to Improve Student Learning. It reported that the metacognitive skills of students in classes that used exam wrappers increased more across the semester than those of students in courses that did not employ exam wrappers. In addition, an end-of-semester survey found that among students who were given exam wrappers, more than half cited specific changes they had made in their approach to learning and studying as a result of filling out the wrapper.
The practice of using exam wrappers is beginning to spread to other universities and to K‚Äì12 schools. Lorie Xikes teaches at Riverdale High School in Fort Myers, Fla., and has used exam wrappers in her AP Biology class. When she hands back graded tests, the exam wrapper includes such questions as:
Based on your responses to the questions above, name at least three things you will do differently in preparing for the next test. BE SPECIFIC.
‚ÄúStudents usually just want to know their grade, and that's it,‚Äù Xikes says. ‚ÄúHaving them fill out the exam wrapper makes them stop and think about how they go about getting ready for a test and whether their approach is working for them or not.‚Äù
In addition to distributing exam wrappers, Xikes also devotes class time to going over the graded exam, question by question‚Äîfeedback that helps students develop the crucial capacity of ‚Äúmetacognitive monitoring,‚Äù that is, keeping tabs on what they know and what they still need to learn. Research on retrieval practice shows that testing can identify specific gaps in students' knowledge, as well as puncture the general overconfidence to which students are susceptible‚Äîbut only if prompt feedback is provided as a corrective.
Over time, repeated exposure to this testing-feedback loop can motivate students to develop the ability to monitor their own mental processes. Affluent students who receive a top-notch education may acquire this skill as a matter of course, but this capacity is often lacking among low-income students who attend struggling schools‚Äîholding out the hopeful possibility that retrieval practice could actually begin to close achievement gaps between the advantaged and the underprivileged.
This is just what James Pennebaker and Samuel Gosling, professors at the University of Texas at Austin, found when they instituted daily quizzes in the large psychology course they teach together. The quizzes were given online, using software that informed students whether they had responded correctly to a question immediately after they submitted an answer. The grades earned by the 901 students in the course featuring daily quizzes were, on average, about half a letter grade higher than those earned by a comparison group of 935 of Pennebaker and Gosling's previous students, who had experienced a more traditionally designed course covering the same material.
Astonishingly, students who took the daily quizzes in their psychology class also performed better in their other courses, during the semester they were enrolled in Pennebaker and Gosling's class and in the semesters that followed‚Äîsuggesting that the frequent tests accompanied by feedback worked to improve their general skills of self-regulation. Most exciting to the professors, the daily quizzes led to a 50 percent reduction in the achievement gap, as measured by grades, among students of different social classes. ‚ÄúRepeated testing is a powerful practice that directly enhances learning and thinking skills, and it can be especially helpful to students who start off with a weaker academic background,‚Äù Gosling says.
Gosling and Pennebaker, who (along with U.T. graduate student Jason Ferrell) published their findings on the effects of daily quizzes in 2013 in the journal PLOS ONE, credited the ‚Äúrapid, targeted, and structured feedback‚Äù that students received with boosting the effectiveness of repeated testing. And therein lies a dilemma for American public school students, who take an average of 10 standardized tests a year in grades three through eight, according to a recent study conducted by the Center for American Progress. Unlike the instructor-written tests given by the teachers and professors profiled here, standardized tests are usually sold to schools by commercial publishing companies. Scores on these tests often arrive weeks or even months after the test is taken. And to maintain the security of test items‚Äîand to use the items again on future tests‚Äîtesting firms do not offer item-by-item feedback, only a rather uninformative numerical score.
There is yet another feature of standardized state tests that prevents them from being used more effectively as occasions for learning. The questions they ask are overwhelmingly of a superficial nature‚Äîwhich leads, almost inevitably, to superficial learning.
If the state tests currently in use in U.S. were themselves assessed on the difficulty and depth of the questions they ask, almost all of them would flunk. That is the conclusion reached by Kun Yuan and Vi-Nhuan Le, both then behavioral scientists at RAND Corporation, a nonprofit think tank. In a report published in 2012 Yuan and Le evaluated the mathematics and English language arts tests offered by 17 states, rating each question on the tests on the cognitive challenge it poses to the test taker. The researchers used a tool called Webb's Depth of Knowledge‚Äîcreated by Norman Webb, a senior scientist at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research‚Äîwhich identifies four levels of mental rigor, from DOK1 (simple recall), to DOK2 (application of skills and concepts), through DOK3 (reasoning and inference), and DOK4 (extended planning and investigation).
Most questions on the state tests Yuan and Le examined were at level DOK1 or DOK2. The authors used level DOK4 as their benchmark for questions that measure deeper learning, and by this standard the tests are failing utterly. Only 1 to 6 percent of students were assessed on deeper learning in reading through state tests, Yuan and Le report; 2 to 3 percent were assessed on deeper learning in writing; and 0 percent were assessed on deeper learning in mathematics. ‚ÄúWhat tests measure matters because what's on the tests tends to drive instruction,‚Äù observes Linda Darling-Hammond, emeritus professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education and a national authority on learning and assessment. That is especially true, she notes, when rewards and punishments are attached to the outcomes of the tests, as is the case under the No Child Left Behind law and states' own ‚Äúaccountability‚Äù measures.
According to Darling-Hammond, the provisions of No Child Left Behind effectively forced states to employ inexpensive, multiple-choice tests that could be scored by machine‚Äîand it is all but impossible, she contends, for such tests to measure deep learning. But other kinds of tests could do so. Darling-Hammond wrote, with her Stanford colleague Frank Adamson, the 2014 book Beyond the Bubble Test, which describes a very different vision of assessment: tests that pose open-ended questions (the answers to which are evaluated by teachers, not machines); that call on students to develop and defend an argument; and that ask test takers to conduct a scientific experiment or construct a research report.
In the 1990s Darling-Hammond points out, some American states had begun to administer such tests; that effort ended with the passage of No Child Left Behind. She acknowledges that the movement toward more sophisticated tests also stalled because of concerns about logistics and cost. Still, assessing students in this way is not a pie-in-the-sky fantasy: Other nations, such as England and Australia, are doing so already. ‚ÄúTheir students are performing the work of real scientists and historians, while our students are filling in bubbles,‚Äù Darling-Hammond says. ‚ÄúIt's pitiful.‚Äù
She does see some cause for optimism: A new generation of tests are being developed in the U.S. to assess how well students have met the Common Core State Standards, the set of academic benchmarks in literacy and math that have been adopted by 43 states. Two of these tests‚ÄîSmarter Balanced and Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC)‚Äîshow promise as tests of deep learning, says Darling-Hammond, pointing to a recent evaluation conducted by Joan Herman and Robert Linn, researchers at U.C.L.A.'s National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST). Herman notes that both tests intend to emphasize questions at and above level 2 on Webb's Depth of Knowledge, with at least a third of a student's total possible score coming from questions at DOK3 and DOK4. ‚ÄúPARCC and Smarter Balanced may not go as far as we would have liked,‚Äù Herman conceded in a blog post last year, but ‚Äúthey are likely to produce a big step forward.‚Äù},

But what underlies the feelings of dread effected by math anxiety? Are HMAs‚Äô feelings about math merely psychological epiphenomena, or is their anxiety grounded in simulation of a concrete, visceral sensation ‚Äì such as pain ‚Äì about which they have every right to feel anxious? We show that, when anticipating an upcoming math-task, the higher one‚Äôs math anxiety, the more one increases activity in regions associated with visceral threat detection, and often the experience of pain itself (bilateral dorso-posterior insula). Interestingly, this relation was not seen during math performance, suggesting that it is not that math itself hurts; rather, the anticipation of math is painful. Our data suggest that pain network activation underlies the intuition that simply anticipating a dreaded event can feel painful. These results may also provide a potential neural mechanism to explain why HMAs tend to avoid math and math-related situations, which in turn can bias HMAs away from taking math classes or even entire math-related career paths.},

Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surprising phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving retention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assessment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally, we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

However, many students lack metacognitive awareness of the benefits of practicing active retrieval. We describe two approaches to addressing this problem: classroom quizzing and a computer-based learning program that guides students to practice retrieval. Retrieval processes must be considered in any analysis of learning, and incorporating retrieval into educational activities represents a powerful way to enhance learning.},

@book{lieven2009crosslinguistic,
  abstract = {This volume covers state-of-the-art research in the field of crosslinguistic approaches to the psychology of language. The forty chapters cover a wide range of topics that represent the many research interests of a pioneer, Dan Isaac Slobin, who has been a major intellectual and creative force in the field of child language development, linguistics, and psycholinguistics for the past four decades. Slobin has insisted on a rigorous, crosslinguistic approach in his attempt to identify universal developmental patterns in language learning, to explore the effects of particular types of languages on psycholinguistic processes, to determine the extent to which universals of language and language behavior are determined by modality (vocal/auditory vs. manual/visual) and, finally, to investigate the relation between linguistic and cognitive processes. In this volume, researchers take up the challenge of the differences between languages to forward research in four major areas with which Slobin has been concerned throughout his career: language learning in crosslinguistic perspective (spoken and sign languages); the integration of language specific factors in narrative skill; theoretical issues in typology, language development and language change; and, the relationship between language and cognition. All chapters are written by leading researchers currently working in these fields, who are Slobin's colleagues, collaborators or former students in linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and cognitive science. Each section starts with an introductory chapter that connects the themes of the chapters and reviews Slobin's contribution in the context of past research trends and future directions. The whole volume focuses squarely on the central argument: universals of human language and of its development are embodied and revealed in its diverse manifestations and utilization. "Crosslinguistic Approaches to the Study of Language" is a key resource for those interested in the range of differences between languages and how this impacts on learning, cognition and language change, and a tribute to Dan Slobin's momentous contribution to the field.},

  abstract = {Whether you are a student struggling to fulfill a math or science requirement, or you are embarking on a career change that requires a new skill set, A Mind for Numbers offers the tools you need to get a better grasp of that intimidating material. Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options‚Äîboth to rise in the military and to explore other careers‚Äîshe returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.

In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively‚Äîsecrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they‚Äôd known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there‚Äôs only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions‚Äîyou just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science, but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think!},

We leverage the SAT-based Alloy tool-set to reduce the problem of generating valid SQL queries into a SAT problem. Our approach translates SQL query constraints into Alloy models, which enable it to generate valid queries that cannot be automatically generated using conventional grammar-based generators. Given a database schema, our new approach combined with our previous work on ADUSA, automatically generates (1) syntactically and semantically valid SQL queries for testing, (2) input data to populate test databases, and (3) expected result of executing the given query on the generated data. Experimental results show that not only can we automatically generate valid queries which detect bugs in database engines, but also we are able to combine this work with our previous work on ADUSA to automatically generate input queries and tables as well as expected query execution outputs to enable automated testing of database engines.},

The second edition of Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference includes updated chapters reflecting the state of the art of research in this area. Coverage of sleep and memory has been significantly expanded while neuromodulators in memory processing, neurogenesis and epigenetics are also covered in greater detail. New chapters have been included to reflect the massive increase in research into working memory and the educational relevance of memory research.

The most comprehensive and authoritative resource available on the study of learning and memory and its mechanisms. Chapters in each section offer detailed and complex coverage of the topics under discussion, providing an authoritative introduction  and enabling users to quickly understand complex subjects
The work incorporates the expertise of over 150 outstanding investigators in the field, providing a ‚Äòone-stop‚Äô resource of reputable information from world-leading scholars with easy cross-referencing of related articles to promote understanding and further research
Thematic structuring of the work encourages easy searchability of topics. Suggested further reading for each chapter helps readers to continue their research in more depth and a glossary of key terms is a helpful guide for users unfamiliar with neuroscience terminology},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that language evolution is a process of cultural change, in which linguistic structures are shaped through repeated cycles of learning and use by domain-general mechanisms. This paper draws out the implications of this viewpoint for understanding the problem of language acquisition, which is cast in a new, and much more tractable, form. In essence, the child faces a problem of induction, where the objective is to coordinate with others (C-induction), rather than to model the structure of the natural world (N-induction). We argue that, of the two, C-induction is dramatically easier. More broadly, we argue that understanding the acquisition of any cultural form, whether linguistic or otherwise, during development, requires considering the corresponding question of how that cultural form arose through processes of cultural evolution. This perspective helps resolve the ‚Äúlogical‚Äù problem of language acquisition and has far-reaching implications for evolutionary psychology.},

  abstract = {Texts with potential educational value are becoming available through the Internet (e.g., Wikipedia, news services). However, using these new texts in classrooms introduces many challenges, one of which is that they usually lack practice exercises and assessments. Here, we address part of this challenge by automating the creation of a specific type of assessment item.

 Specifically, we focus on automatically generating factual WH questions. Our goal is to create an automated system that can take as input a text and produce as output questions for assessing a reader's knowledge of the information in the text. The questions could then be presented to a teacher, who could select and revise the ones that he or she judges to be useful.


After introducing the problem, we describe some of the computational and linguistic challenges presented by factual question generation. We then present an implemented system that leverages existing natural language processing techniques to address some of these challenges. The system uses a combination of manually encoded transformation rules and a statistical question ranker trained on a tailored dataset of labeled system output.


We present experiments that evaluate individual components of the system as well as the system as a whole. We found, among other things, that the question ranker roughly doubled the acceptability rate of top-ranked questions.


In a user study, we tested whether K-12 teachers could efficiently create factual questions by selecting and revising suggestions from the system. Offering automatic suggestions reduced the time and effort spent by participants, though it also affected the types of questions that were created.

This research supports the idea that natural language processing can help teachers efficiently create instructional content. It provides solutions to some of the major challenges in question generation and an analysis and better understanding of those that remain.},

Many problems that arise in specific instances ‚Äî including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions ‚Äî are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, we develop general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. We describe how a wide variety of algorithms -- among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, max-product and linear programming relaxation, as well as conic programming relaxations -- can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

First, research reveals that testing, although typically used merely as an assessment device, directly potentiates learning and does so more effectively than other modes of study. Second, recent analysis of the temporal dynamics of learning show that learning is most durable when study time is distributed over much greater periods of time than is customary in educational settings. Third, the interleaving of different types of practice problems (which is quite rare in math and science texts) markedly improves learning.

The discussion then moves to the fundamentals applied to inferring a binomial probability, before concluding with chapters on the generalized linear model. Topics include metric-predicted variable on one or two groups; metric-predicted variable with one metric predictor; metric-predicted variable with multiple metric predictors; metric-predicted variable with one nominal predictor; and metric-predicted variable with multiple nominal predictors. The exercises found in the text have explicit purposes and guidelines for accomplishment.

Modern architectures have to control access not only to single, isolated systems, but to whole business-spanning federations of applications and services.

As an approach to such problems, in this paper, we introduce a solution catalogue of reusable building blocks for Identity and Access Management (IAM). The concepts of these blocks have been realized in a configurable system that supports IAM solutions for Web-based applications.},

Increasingly, this means providing students information in online classrooms to help them reach their highest potential. The acts of teaching and learning online generate data, but to date, that information has remained largely untapped for assessing student performance.

Using data generated by students in an online Master of Public Administration program, drawn from the Marist College Open Academic Analytics Initiative, we identify and analyze characteristics and behaviors that best provide early indication of a student being academically at risk, paying particular attention to the usage of online tools. We find that fairly simple learning analytics models achieve high levels of sensitivity (over 80\% of at-risk students identified) with relatively low false positive rates (13.5\%). Results will be used to test interventions for improving student performance in real time.},

  abstract = {The more real business and interaction with public authorities is performed in digital form, the more important the handling of identities over open networks becomes. The rise in identity theft as a result of the misuse of global but unprotected identifiers like credit card numbers is one strong indicator of this. Setting up individual passwords between a person and every organization he or she interacts with also offers very limited security in practice. Federated identity management addresses this critical issue. Classic proposals like Kerberos and PKIs never gained wide acceptance because of two problems: actual deployment to end users and privacy. We describe modern approaches that solve these problems. The first approach is browser-based protocols, where the user only needs a standard browser without special settings. We discuss the specific protocol types and security challenges of this protocol class, as well as what level of privacy can and cannot be achieved within this class. The second approach, private credentials, solves the problems that none of the prior solutions could solve, but requires the user to install some local software. Private credentials allow the user to reveal only the minimum information necessary to conduct transactions. In particular, it enables unlinkable transactions even for certified attributes. We sketch the cryptographic solutions and describe how optional properties such as revocability can be achieved, in particular in the idemix system.},

Presents core methods for data clustering, including probabilistic, density- and grid-based, and spectral clustering
Explores various problems and scenarios pertaining to multimedia, text, biological, categorical, network, streams, and uncertain data
Offers in-depth insight on the clustering process, including different ways to cluster the same data set
Includes an extensive bibliography at the end of each chapter
Summary

Research on the problem of clustering tends to be fragmented across the pattern recognition, database, data mining, and machine learning communities. Addressing this problem in a unified way, Data Clustering: Algorithms and Applications provides complete coverage of the entire area of clustering, from basic methods to more refined and complex data clustering approaches. It pays special attention to recent issues in graphs, social networks, and other domains.

The book focuses on three primary aspects of data clustering:

Methods, describing key techniques commonly used for clustering, such as feature selection, agglomerative clustering, partitional clustering, density-based clustering, probabilistic clustering, grid-based clustering, spectral clustering, and nonnegative matrix factorization
Domains, covering methods used for different domains of data, such as categorical data, text data, multimedia data, graph data, biological data, stream data, uncertain data, time series clustering, high-dimensional clustering, and big data
Variations and Insights, discussing important variations of the clustering process, such as semisupervised clustering, interactive clustering, multiview clustering, cluster ensembles, and cluster validation
In this book, top researchers from around the world explore the characteristics of clustering problems in a variety of application areas. They also explain how to glean detailed insight from the clustering process‚Äîincluding how to verify the quality of the underlying clusters‚Äîthrough supervision, human intervention, or the automated generation of alternative clusters.},

We hypothesized that making students more self-reflective about how they should approach their learning with the resources available to them would improve their class performance. We designed a novel Strategic Resource Use intervention that students could self-administer online and tested its effects in two cohorts of a college-level introductory statistics class. Before each exam, students randomly assigned to the treatment condition strategized about which academic resources they would use for studying, why each resource would be useful, and how they would use their resources. Students randomly assigned to the treatment condition reported being more self-reflective about their learning throughout the class, used their resources more effectively, and outperformed students in the control condition by an average of one third of a letter grade in the class.},

@article{kurt2017seconds,
  abstract = {This paper moves away from reminiscent mechanical repetition and drills, which were in vogue when teaching vocabulary before the rise of technology. With the support of technology, innovative methodologies that are more effective and enjoyable can be implemented into vocabulary teaching. In this particular context, there seems to be a lack of technology integration in vocabulary teaching because of teachers being untrained and/or not provided with the necessary technology. The aim of this study was to foster vocabulary development through the implementation of Vine vocabulary videos in English vocabulary learning. An embedded mixed methods design was employed to collect necessary data for analysis. The results of the post-test revealed that the practice of Vine vocabulary videos was effective and improved participants' vocabulary. The content analysis of the semi-structured interviews carried out with participants indicated that they had enjoyed the whole process and found it very motivating and effective. This study claims that adopting smartphones into a vocabulary course will enable English as a foreign language learners to expand and consolidate their vocabulary learning outside the classroom, engage them in a collaborative learning environment, practice and use the language being learnt and share their knowledge and experiences with their peers.

Practitioner Notes
What is already known about this topic:


* Mobile technologies are widely used to improve English language learners' vocabulary.

* Vine is a well-known application used by people to expose their videos in 6 s.

* Motivating English language learners to improve their vocabulary has always been challenging.

* Adopting smartphones into a vocabulary course will enable EFL learners to expand and consolidate their learning outside the classroom and share their knowledge and experiences with their peers.

What this paper adds:


* Learner-prepared VVVs have been used in a course to improve English language learners' vocabulary in a joyous way.

* Through VVVs, learners developed their creative and imaginary skills.

* VVVs were discovered to be an effective tool for subconscious collaborative vocabulary learning.

* VVVs motivate, encourage and therefore induce language learners to allocate more time to the educational applications of mobile and internet technologies.

* While preparing VVVs, students improved their collaborative and language skills.

Implications for practice and/or policy:


* More guidance on how to make better VVVs should be given to students.

* Learners should be involved in producing course materials through VVVs.

* Learners should be exposed to more visual sample representations of target vocabulary.

* Preparing VVVs should be part of every English language syllabus because they are verified to improve the language skills of learners.

  abstract = {With more than three-quarters of a million copies sold since its first publication, The Craft of Research has helped generations of researchers at every level‚Äîfrom first-year undergraduates to advanced graduate students to research reporters in business and government‚Äîlearn how to conduct effective and meaningful research. Conceived by seasoned researchers and educators Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, and Joseph M. Williams, this fundamental work explains how to find and evaluate sources, anticipate and respond to reader reservations, and integrate these pieces into an argument that stands up to reader critique.

The fourth edition has been thoroughly but respectfully revised by Joseph Bizup and William T. FitzGerald. It retains the original five-part structure, as well as the sound advice of earlier editions, but reflects the way research and writing are taught and practiced today. Its chapters on finding and engaging sources now incorporate recent developments in library and Internet research, emphasizing new techniques made possible by online databases and search engines. Bizup and FitzGerald provide fresh examples and standardized terminology to clarify concepts like argument, warrant, and problem.

Following the same guiding principle as earlier editions‚Äîthat the skills of doing and reporting research are not just for elite students but for everyone‚Äîthis new edition retains the accessible voice and direct approach that have made The Craft of Research a leader in the field of research reference. With updated examples and information on evaluation and using contemporary sources, this beloved classic is ready for the next generation of researchers.},

Sloan Foundation to conduct a longitudinal study of undergraduate women pursuing degrees in science or engineering. Cohorts of approximately 100 students have been added to the study each year, for a current total of 672 participants. The objectives are: (a) to determine an accurate measure of retention by tracking individual students through their science and engineering academic careers; (b) to examine factors affecting retention of women in science and engineering; and (c) to evaluate the effectiveness of WIE's programs targeted at increasing enrollment and retention of women in science and engineering. These programs include interventions primarily during the freshman and sophomore years, which are critical attrition points. The results of this study are reported annually to the Dean of Engineering and related departments for consideration in policy formulation. Annual results of the study have shown consistent patterns of persistence factors and barriers for these high-achieving women; most notably a significant drop in academic self-confidence during their freshman year in college. In addition, individual tracking of these women has shown a retention that is much higher than the estimated national average for engineering and science students.},

The author's emphasis is on providing a unified treatment of linear models, including analysis of variance models and regression models, based on projections, orthogonality, and other vector space ideas. Every chapter comes with numerous exercises and examples that make it ideal for a graduate-level course. All of the standard topics are covered in depth: ANOVA, estimation including Bayesian estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple comparisons, regression analysis, and experimental design models. In addition, the book covers topics that are not usually treated at this level, but which are important in their own right: balanced incomplete block designs, testing for lack of fit, testing for independence, models with singular covariance matrices, variance component estimation, best linear and best linear unbiased prediction, collinearity, and variable selection. This new edition includes a more extensive discussion of best prediction and associated ideas of R2, as well as new sections on inner products and perpendicular projections for more general spaces and Milliken and Graybill‚Äôs generalization of Tukey‚Äôs one degree of freedom for nonadditivity test.},

In response to these concerns, a program was initiated in the Boise State University College of Engineering to improve lower division retention via research and internships. Inclusion of lower division students in both university research and industry internships is contrary to prevailing perceptions of student capabilities. However, lower division engineering students generally possess numerous basic skills that enable them to work in an engineering environment where they can gain experience and confidence. Phase One of the Retention through Research and Internships Program was a pilot program in which seven first year engineering students were placed in research laboratories with faculty mentors within the College of Engineering during the 2004-05 academic year. At the beginning of the Fall 2005 semester, 100% of the participating students remained in the program. In addition, interviews of the students revealed that many believed that the research laboratory experience and environment increased their confidence and motivation, and was pivotal in their decision to remain in engineering. As a result of the successful Phase One pilot program, a Phase Two program has been initiated, in which first and second year engineering students are being placed in industry internships during the academic year 2005-06.},

The application focuses on systems biology with emphasis on modeling pathways and signaling mechanisms from high-throughput molecular data. Bayesian networks have proven to be especially useful abstractions in this regard. Their usefulness is especially exemplified by their ability to discover new associations in addition to validating known ones across the molecules of interest. It is also expected that the prevalence of publicly available high-throughput biological data sets may encourage the audience to explore investigating novel paradigms using the approaches presented in the book.},

  abstract = {An established memory can be made transiently labile if retrieved or reactivated. Over time, it becomes again resistant to disruption and this process that renders the memory stable is termed reconsolidation. The reasons why a memory becomes labile after retrieval and reconsolidates still remains debated. Here, using inhibitory avoidance (IA) learning in rats, we provide evidence that retrievals of a young memory, which are accompanied by its reconsolidation, result in memory strengthening and contribute to its overall consolidation. This function associated to reconsolidation is temporally limited. With the passage of time, the stored memory undergoes important changes, as revealed by the behavioral outcomes of its retrieval. Over time, without explicit retrievals, memory first strengthens and becomes refractory to both retrieval-dependent interference and strengthening. At later times, the same retrievals that lead to reconsolidation of a young memory extinguish an older memory. We conclude that the storage of information is very dynamic and that its temporal evolution regulates behavioral outcomes. These results are important for potential clinical applications.},

Identity management has been recently considered to be a viable solution for simplifying user management across enterprise applications. The network identity of each user is the global set of personal credentials and preferences constituting the various accounts. The prevalence of business alliances or coalitions necessitates the further evolution of identity management, named federated identity management (FIM). The main motivation of FIM is to facilitate the federation of identities among business partners emphasizing on ease of user management. In this paper, we investigate privacy issues in FIM, especially focusing on Liberty Alliance approach. We attempt to identify practical business scenarios that help us understand privacy issues in FIM. Also, we propose systematic mechanisms to specify privacy preferences in FIM.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics.

The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.

The book was awarded the 2009 DeGroot Prize of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis.},

  abstract = {The recent upsurge in enrollments in computing means that student attrition has a substantial opportunity cost. Admitting a student who leaves both reduces graduation yield and prevents another equally qualified student from enrolling. Professors cannot change the background of students, but they can control many aspects of student experience in the computing major. This paper presents the results of a study to understand strongest predictors of retention in undergraduate computing based on a large-scale survey administered in 14 U.S. institutions. Although some factors have more influence for certain demographic groups, findings from this data set suggest that some teaching practices have more power for predicting retention in computing including: relevant and meaningful assignments, examples, and curriculum; faculty interaction with students; student collaboration on programming assignments; and for male students, pace and workload expectations relative to existing experience. Other interactions such as those that a student has with teaching assistants or peers in extracurricular activities seem to have less value for predicting retention. Faculty would be wise to protect their enrollment investments by inspecting course themes, assignments, and examples for student interest and ensuring that students have many opportunities to interact with faculty both in and outside of class.},

The notion of identity is the important component of this vehicle. When users interact with services on the Internet, they often tailor the services in some way for their personal use. For example, a user may establish an account with a username and password and/or set some preferences for what information the user wants displayed and how the user wants it displayed. The network identity of each user is the overall global set of these attributes constituting the various accounts. In this paper, we investigate two well-known federated identity management (FIM) solutions, Microsoft Passport and Liberty Alliance, attempting to identify information assurance (IA) requirements in FIM. In particular, we focus on principal IA requirements for Web services (WS) which plays an integral role in enriching identity management through federation.},

@article{raelin2014gendered,
  abstract = {Background
Longstanding data have established that women earn about 20% of undergraduate degrees in engineering; they also have lower academic self-efficacy in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields than do men. This study examines these findings through a longitudinal design that explores whether cooperative education (co-op) can improve the retention of women (and men) in their undergraduate studies.

Purpose
This study examines the effect on retention of demographic characteristics, cooperative education, contextual support, and three dimensions of self-efficacy ‚Äì work, career, and academic ‚Äì and their change over time. It incorporates longitudinal measures and a data check at the end of the students' fifth year.

Design/Method
Respondents filled out 20-minute surveys, approximately one year apart, during three separate time periods. The study introduced and validated a number of new scales. The data for each time period were submitted to successive analyses.

Results
The findings verified the study's pathways model. Academic achievement and academic self-efficacy, as well as contextual support in the case for women, in all time periods were critical to retention. Work self-efficacy, developed by students between their second and fourth years, was also an important factor in retention, although it was strongly tied to the students' participation in co-op programs. Higher retention was associated with an increased number of co-ops completed by students.

Conclusion
Relationships between work self-efficacy and co-op participation and between academic self-efficacy and academic achievement play a critical role in retention for both male and female students.

Could sleeping after goal encoding promote later execution? We evaluated this possibility by instructing participants to execute a prospective memory goal after a short delay (20 min), a 12-hr wake delay, or a 12-hr sleep delay. Goal execution declined after the 12-hr wake delay relative to the short delay. In contrast, goal execution was relatively preserved after the 12-hr sleep delay relative to the short delay. The sleep-enhanced goal execution was not accompanied by a decline in performance of an ongoing task in which the prospective memory goal was embedded, which suggests that the effect was not a consequence of attentional resources being reallocated from the ongoing task to the prospective memory goal. Our results suggest that consolidation processes active during sleep increase the probability that a goal will be spontaneously retrieved and executed.},

Further, in LDA all topics are in principle present in every document. By contrast, our model gives sparse topic representation, determining the (small) subset of relevant topics for each document. We derive a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), balancing model complexity and goodness of fit. Here, interestingly, we identify an effective sample size and corresponding penalty specific to each parameter type in our model. We minimize BIC to jointly determine our entire model‚Äîthe topic-specific words, document-specific topics, all model parameter values, and the total number of topics‚Äîin a wholly unsupervised fashion.

@article{macfadyen2010mining,
  abstract = {Earlier studies have suggested that higher education institutions could harness the predictive power of Learning Management System (LMS) data to develop reporting tools that identify at-risk students and allow for more timely pedagogical interventions. This paper confirms and extends this proposition by providing data from an international research project investigating which student online activities accurately predict academic achievement. Analysis of LMS tracking data from a Blackboard Vista-supported course identified 15 variables demonstrating a significant simple correlation with student final grade. Regression modelling generated a best-fit predictive model for this course which incorporates key variables such as total number of discussion messages posted, total number of mail messages sent, and total number of assessments completed and which explains more than 30% of the variation in student final grade. Logistic modelling demonstrated the predictive power of this model, which correctly identified 81% of students who achieved a failing grade. Moreover, network analysis of course discussion forums afforded insight into the development of the student learning community by identifying disconnected students, patterns of student-to-student communication, and instructor positioning within the network. This study affirms that pedagogically meaningful information can be extracted from LMS-generated student tracking data, and discusses how these findings are informing the development of a customizable dashboard-like reporting tool for educators that will extract and visualize real-time data on student engagement and likelihood of success.},

  abstract = {Although memory performance benefits from the spacing of information at encoding, judgments of learning (JOLs) are often not sensitive to the benefits of spacing. The present research examines how practice, feedback, and instruction influence JOLs for spaced and massed items. In Experiment 1, in which JOLs were made after the presentation of each item and participants were given multiple study-test cycles, JOLs were strongly influenced by the repetition of the items, but there was little difference in JOLs for massed versus spaced items. A similar effect was shown in Experiments 2 and 3, in which participants scored their own recall performance and were given feedback, although participants did learn to assign higher JOLs to spaced items with task experience. In Experiment 4, after participants were given direct instruction about the benefits of spacing, they showed a greater difference for JOLs of spaced vs massed items, but their JOLs still underestimated their recall for spaced items. Although spacing effects are very robust and have important implications for memory and education, people often underestimate the benefits of spaced repetition when learning, possibly due to the reliance on processing fluency during study and attending to repetition, and not taking into account the beneficial aspects of study schedule.},

  abstract = {Flexibility in applying existing knowledge to similar cues is a corner stone of memory development in infants. Here, we examine the effect of sleep on the flexibility of memory retrieval using a deferred imitation paradigm. Forty-eight 12-month-old infants were randomly assigned to either a nap or a no-nap demonstration condition (scheduled around their natural daytime sleep schedule) or to a baseline control condition. In the demonstration conditions, infants watched an experimenter perform three target actions on a hand puppet. Immediately afterwards, infants were allowed to practice the target actions three times. In a test session 4-hr later, infants were given the opportunity to reproduce the actions with a novel hand puppet differing in color from the puppet used during the demonstration session. Only infants in the nap-condition performed significantly more target actions than infants in the baseline control condition. Furthermore, they were faster to carry out the first target action than infants in the no-nap condition. We conclude that sleep had a facilitative effect on infants‚Äô flexibility of memory retrieval.

@book{meyer2010threshold,
  abstract = {Over the last decade the notion of 'threshold concepts' has proved influential around the world as a powerful means of exploring and discussing the key points of transformation that students experience in their higher education courses and the 'troublesome knowledge' that these often present. Threshold concepts provoke in the learner a state of 'liminality' in which transformation takes place, requiring the integration of new understanding and the letting go of previous learning stances. Insights gained by learners as they cross thresholds can be exhilarating but might also be unsettling, requiring an uncomfortable shift in identity, or, paradoxically, a sense of loss. The liminal space can be a suspended state of partial understanding, or 'stuck place', in which understanding approximates to a kind of 'mimicry'. "Threshold Concepts and Transformational Learning" substantially increases the empirical evidence for threshold concepts across a large number of disciplinary contexts and from the higher education sectors of many countries. This new volume develops further theoretical perspectives and provides fresh pedagogical directions. It will be of interest to teachers, practitioners and managers in all disciplines as well as to educational researchers.},

@article{criminisi2012decision,
  abstract = {This review presents a unified, efficient model of random decision forests which can be applied to a number of machine learning, computer vision, and medical image analysis tasks.

Our model extends existing forest-based techniques as it unifies classification, regression, density estimation, manifold learning, semisupervised learning, and active learning under the same decision forest framework. This gives us the opportunity to write and optimize the core implementation only once, with application to many diverse tasks.
The proposed model may be used both in a discriminative or generative way and may be applied to discrete or continuous, labeled or unlabeled data.


The main contributions of this review are: (1) Proposing a unified, probabilistic and efficient model for a variety of learning tasks; (2) Demonstrating margin-maximizing properties of classification forests; (3) Discussing probabilistic regression forests in comparison with other nonlinear regression algorithms; (4) Introducing density forests for estimating probability density functions; (5) Proposing an efficient algorithm for sampling from a density forest; (6) Introducing manifold forests for nonlinear dimensionality reduction; (7) Proposing new algorithms for transductive learning and active learning. Finally, we discuss how alternatives such as random ferns and extremely randomized trees stem from our more general forest model.


This document is directed at both students who wish to learn the basics of decision forests, as well as researchers interested in the new contributions. It presents both fundamental and novel concepts in a structured way, with many illustrative examples and real-world applications. Thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms such as support vector machines, boosting and Gaussian processes are presented and relative advantages and disadvantages discussed. The many synthetic examples and existing commercial applications demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and its flexibility.},

  abstract = {In declarative data cleaning, data semantics are encoded as constraints and errors arise when the data violates the constraints. Various forms of statistical and logical inference can be used to reason about and repair inconsistencies (errors) in data. Recently, unified approaches that repair both errors in data and errors in semantics (the constraints) have been proposed. However, both data-only approaches and unified approaches are by and large static in that they apply cleaning to a single snapshot of the data and constraints. We introduce a continuous data cleaning framework that can be applied to dynamic data and constraint environments. Our approach permits both the data and its semantics to evolve and suggests repairs based on the accumulated evidence to date. Importantly, our approach uses not only the data and constraints as evidence, but also considers the past repairs chosen and applied by a user (user repair preferences). We introduce a repair classifier that predicts the type of repair needed to resolve an inconsistency, and that learns from past user repair preferences to recommend more accurate repairs in the future. Our evaluation shows that our techniques achieve high prediction accuracy and generate high quality repairs. Of independent interest, our work makes use of a set of data statistics that are shown to be sensitive to predicting particular repair types.
Note: As originally published there are errors in the document. The authors note the following corrections to Section V "Classification Framework:" For the group 6 statistics, the definition of V_X should be V_X = {\Pi_X(t) | t \in I \ F } ; For the group 7 statistics, the definition of S_X should be S_X = {\Pi_X(t) | t \notin I \ F }; and For the group 8 statistics, the definition of V_A should be V_A = {\Pi_A(t) | t \in I \ F, \Pi_X(t) = \Pi_X(p) }.},

Summary

Understand the Foundations of Bayesian Networks‚ÄîCore Properties and Definitions Explained

Bayesian Networks: With Examples in R introduces Bayesian networks using a hands-on approach. Simple yet meaningful examples in R illustrate each step of the modeling process. The examples start from the simplest notions and gradually increase in complexity. The authors also distinguish the probabilistic models from their estimation with data sets.

The first three chapters explain the whole process of Bayesian network modeling, from structure learning to parameter learning to inference. These chapters cover discrete Bayesian, Gaussian Bayesian, and hybrid networks, including arbitrary random variables.

The book then gives a concise but rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of Bayesian networks and offers an introduction to causal Bayesian networks. It also presents an overview of R and other software packages appropriate for Bayesian networks. The final chapter evaluates two real-world examples: a landmark causal protein signaling network paper and graphical modeling approaches for predicting the composition of different body parts.

Suitable for graduate students and non-statisticians, this text provides an introductory overview of Bayesian networks. It gives readers a clear, practical understanding of the general approach and steps involved.},

@book{mirkin2012clustering,
  abstract = {Features

Provides detailed coverage of selected clustering techniques, notably K-means, divisive clustering, network clustering, spectral clustering, additive clustering, and consensus clustering
Emphasizes the application of the methods through detailed case studies
Offers MATLAB¬Æ code for the examples on the book‚Äôs website
Illustrates methods by computation on specially selected small real-world datasets
Gives an extensive advice on computational interpretation of clusters, including use of hierarchical ontologies
Summary

Often considered more of an art than a science, books on clustering have been dominated by learning through example with techniques chosen almost through trial and error. Even the two most popular, and most related, clustering methods‚ÄîK-Means for partitioning and Ward's method for hierarchical clustering‚Äîhave lacked the theoretical underpinning required to establish a firm relationship between the two methods and relevant interpretation aids. Other approaches, such as spectral clustering or consensus clustering, are considered absolutely unrelated to each other or to the two above mentioned methods.

Clustering: A Data Recovery Approach, Second Edition presents a unified modeling approach for the most popular clustering methods: the K-Means and hierarchical techniques, especially for divisive clustering. It significantly expands coverage of the mathematics of data recovery, and includes a new chapter covering more recent popular network clustering approaches‚Äîspectral, modularity and uniform, additive, and consensus‚Äîtreated within the same data recovery approach. Another added chapter covers cluster validation and interpretation, including recent developments for ontology-driven interpretation of clusters. Altogether, the insertions added a hundred pages to the book, even in spite of the fact that fragments unrelated to the main topics were removed.

Illustrated using a set of small real-world datasets and more than a hundred examples, the book is oriented towards students, practitioners, and theoreticians of cluster analysis. Covering topics that are beyond the scope of most texts, the author‚Äôs explanations of data recovery methods, theory-based advice, pre- and post-processing issues and his clear, practical instructions for real-world data mining make this book ideally suited for teaching, self-study, and professional reference.},

@article{shokouhi2011federated,
  abstract = {Federated search (federated information retrieval or distributed information retrieval) is a technique for searching multiple text collections simultaneously. Queries are submitted to a subset of collections that are most likely to return relevant answers. The results returned by selected collections are integrated and merged into a single list. Federated search is preferred over centralized search alternatives in many environments. For example, commercial search engines such as Google cannot easily index uncrawlable hidden web collections while federated search systems can search the contents of hidden web collections without crawling. In enterprise environments, where each organization maintains an independent search engine, federated search techniques can provide parallel search over multiple collections.

There are three major challenges in federated search. For each query, a subset of collections that are most likely to return relevant documents are selected. This creates the collection selection problem. To be able to select suitable collections, federated search systems need to acquire some knowledge about the contents of each collection, creating the collection representation problem. The results returned from the selected collections are merged before the final presentation to the user. This final step is the result merging problem.

The goal of this work, is to provide a comprehensive summary of the previous research on the federated search challenges described above.

Web search has significantly evolved in recent years. For many years, web search engines such as Google and Yahoo! were only providing search service over text documents. Aggregated search was one of the first steps to go beyond text search, and was the beginning of a new era for information seeking and retrieval. These days, web search engines support aggregated search over a number of verticals, and blend different types of documents (e.g. images, videos) in their search results. Moreover, web search engines have started to crawl and search the hidden web. Federated search (federated information retrieval or distributed information retrieval) has played a key role in providing the technology for aggregated search and crawling the hidden web. The application of federated search is not limited to the web search engines. There are many scenarios such as digital libraries in which information is distributed across different sources/servers. Peer-to-peer networks and personalized search are two examples in which federated search has been successfully used for searching multiple independent collections. Federated Search provides a comprehensive summary of the research done to date, looks at some of the challenges still to be faced, and suggests some directions for future research on this important and current topic.},

@article{keresztes2013testing,
  abstract = {The testing effect refers to the phenomenon that repeated retrieval of memories promotes better long-term retention than repeated study. To investigate the neural correlates of the testing effect, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging methods while participants performed a cued recall task. Prior to the neuroimaging experiment, participants learned Swahili-German word pairs, then half of the word pairs were repeatedly studied, whereas the other half were repeatedly tested. For half of the participants, the neuroimaging experiment was performed immediately after the learning phase; a 1-week retention interval was inserted for the other half of the participants. We found that a large network of areas identified in a separate 2-back functional localizer scan were active during the final recall of the word pair associations. Importantly, the learning strategy (retest or restudy) of the word pairs determined the manner in which the retention interval affected the activations within this network. Recall of previously restudied memories was accompanied by reduced activation within this network at long retention intervals, but no reduction was observed for previously retested memories. We suggest that retrieval promotes learning via stabilizing cue-related activation patterns in a network of areas usually associated with cognitive and attentional control functions.},

@article{ding2017machine,
  abstract = {Big data validation and system verification are crucial for ensuring the quality of big data applications. However, a rigorous technique for such tasks is yet to emerge. During the past decade, we have developed a big data system called CMA for investigating the classification of biological cells based on cell morphology that is captured in diffraction images. CMA includes a group of scientific software tools, machine learning algorithms, and a large scale cell image repository. We have also developed a framework for rigorous validation of the massive scale image data and verification of both the software systems and machine learning algorithms. Different machine learning algorithms integrated with image processing techniques were used to automate the selection and validation of the massive scale image data in CMA. An experiment based technique guided by a feature selection algorithm was introduced in the framework to select optimal machine learning features. An iterative metamorphic testing approach is applied for testing the scientific software. Due to the non-testable characteristic of the scientific software, a machine learning approach is introduced for developing test oracles iteratively to ensure the adequacy of the test coverage criteria. Performance of the machine learning algorithms is evaluated with the stratified N-fold cross validation and confusion matrix. We describe the design of the proposed framework with CMA as the case study. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through verifying and validating the data set, software systems and algorithms in CMA.},

  abstract = {The automatic extraction of information from unstructured sources has opened up new avenues for querying, organizing, and analyzing data by drawing upon the clean semantics of structured databases and the abundance of unstructured data. The field of information extraction has its genesis in the natural language processing community where the primary impetus came from competitions centered around the recognition of named entities like people names and organization from news articles. As society became more data oriented with easy online access to both structured and unstructured data, new applications of structure extraction came around. Now, there is interest in converting our personal desktops to structured databases, the knowledge in scientific publications to structured records, and harnessing the Internet for structured fact finding queries. Consequently, there are many different communities of researchers bringing in techniques from machine learning, databases, information retrieval, and computational linguistics for various aspects of the information extraction problem.

This review is a survey of information extraction research of over two decades from these diverse communities. We create a taxonomy of the field along various dimensions derived from the nature of the extraction task, the techniques used for extraction, the variety of input resources exploited, and the type of output produced. We elaborate on rule-based and statistical methods for entity and relationship extraction. In each case we highlight the different kinds of models for capturing the diversity of clues driving the recognition process and the algorithms for training and efficiently deploying the models. We survey techniques for optimizing the various steps in an information extraction pipeline, adapting to dynamic data, integrating with existing entities and handling uncertainty in the extraction process.},

  abstract = {Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique for exploring document collections. Because of the increasing prevalence of large datasets, there is a need to improve the scalability of inference for LDA. In this paper, we introduce a novel and flexible large scale topic modeling package in MapReduce (Mr. LDA). As opposed to other techniques which use Gibbs sampling, our proposed framework uses variational inference, which easily fits into a distributed environment. More importantly, this variational implementation, unlike highly tuned and specialized implementations based on Gibbs sampling, is easily extensible. We demonstrate two extensions of the models possible with this scalable framework: informed priors to guide topic discovery and extracting topics from a multilingual corpus. We compare the scalability of Mr. LDA against Mahout, an existing large scale topic modeling package. Mr. LDA out-performs Mahout both in execution speed and held-out likelihood.},

Uses WinBUGS and R for computational problems
Reviews basic concepts of matrix algebra and probability
Includes numerous exercises and real-world examples throughout
Provides data, programming code, and other materials at www.stat.unm.edu/~fletcher
Summary

Emphasizing the use of WinBUGS and R to analyze real data, Bayesian Ideas and Data Analysis: An Introduction for Scientists and Statisticians presents statistical tools to address scientific questions. It highlights foundational issues in statistics, the importance of making accurate predictions, and the need for scientists and statisticians to collaborate in analyzing data. The WinBUGS code provided offers a convenient platform to model and analyze a wide range of data.

The first five chapters of the book contain core material that spans basic Bayesian ideas, calculations, and inference, including modeling one and two sample data from traditional sampling models. The text then covers Monte Carlo methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. After discussing linear structures in regression, it presents binomial regression, normal regression, analysis of variance, and Poisson regression, before extending these methods to handle correlated data. The authors also examine survival analysis and binary diagnostic testing. A complementary chapter on diagnostic testing for continuous outcomes is available on the book‚Äôs website. The last chapter on nonparametric inference explores density estimation and flexible regression modeling of mean functions.

The appropriate statistical analysis of data involves a collaborative effort between scientists and statisticians. Exemplifying this approach, Bayesian Ideas and Data Analysis focuses on the necessary tools and concepts for modeling and analyzing scientific data.

Data sets and codes are provided on a supplemental website.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data. In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling approach using a real-world case study.},

In the past, computer science handled uncertainty by abstracting it away or avoiding it. In the future, instead, computer science needs to embrace uncertainty as a first-class entity. How do we represent uncertainty in our computational models? Probabilities. Thus, we need to make sure that every computer science student learns probability and statistics. Data science, where data drives discovery and decision-making in all fields of study, underscores the importance of having a command of probability and statistics. At the heart of data science is data analytics whose methods such as machine learning rely on probabilistic and statistical reasoning. And since data serve as the currency of any data analytics workflow, explicit representation of probability distributions can help us calculate the degrees of uncertainty throughout a flow. Programming and software engineering courses will need to elevate the status of such data flows to that given to algorithms, data structures, and modular design.

  abstract = {It is well known in the literature that the problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks is very hard to tackle: Its computational complexity is super-exponential in the number of nodes in the worst case and polynomial in most real-world scenarios.Efficient implementations of score-based structure learning benefit from past and current research in optimization theory, which can be adapted to the task by using the network score as the objective function to maximize. This is not true for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called constraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimization in widespread use, backtracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of neighborhood and Markov blanket. In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent versions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of Bayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an alternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used to parallelize constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented in bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks and two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology. We show that on modern multi-core or multiprocessor hardware parallel implementations are preferable over backtracking, which was developed when single-processor machines were the norm.},

A mixed method design was used, combining an online questionnaire consisting of multiple choice questions using a 5-point Likert response scale and open ended questions, with focus group interviews. Focus groups with both students and lecturers provided additional data. Results showed that students experience increased involvement and interaction, that they found the didactical use pleasant and that they were convinced of the need for future use of mobile technology in daily education practice. Focus group interviews with students confirmed these findings under the condition that the used technology was integrated functionally in the lecture. The involved lecturers reported on positive effects and showed themselves to be favorable toward using handheld, mobile technology in large attendance lectures to boost interaction and involvement, even though they admitted to feeling unease about surrendering a level of control over the pedagogic setting.},

Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval systematically and critically reviews the existing work in applying statistical language models to information retrieval, summarizes their contributions, and points out outstanding challenges. Statistical language models have recently been successfully applied to many information retrieval problems. A great deal of recent work has shown that statistical language models not only lead to superior empirical performance, but also facilitate parameter tuning and open up possibilities for modeling non-traditional retrieval problems. In general, statistical language models provide a principled way of modeling various kinds of retrieval problems. Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval reviews the development of this language modeling approach. It surveys a wide range of retrieval models based on language modeling and attempts to make connections between this new family of models and traditional retrieval models. It summarizes the progress made so far in these models and point out remaining challenges to be solved to further increase their impact. Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval is written for readers who already have some basic knowledge about information retrieval. Some knowledge of probability and statistics such as the maximum likelihood estimator is helpful, but not a prerequisite to understanding the high-level discussion.},

Extraction of this information involves detection, localization, tracking, extraction, enhancement, and recognition of the text from a given image. However, variations of text due to differences in size, style, orientation, and alignment, as well as low image contrast and complex background make the problem of automatic text extraction extremely challenging. While comprehensive surveys of related problems such as face detection, document analysis, and image \& video indexing can be found, the problem of text information extraction is not well surveyed.

@techreport{bienkowski2012enhancing,
  abstract = {In data mining and data analytics, tools and techniques once confined to research laboratories are being adopted by forward-looking industries to generate business intelligence for improving decision making. Higher education institutions are beginning to use analytics for improving the services they provide and for increasing student grades and retention. The U.S. Department of Education's National Education Technology Plan, as one part of its model for 21st-century learning powered by technology, envisions ways of using data from online learning systems to improve instruction. With analytics and data mining experiments in education starting to proliferate, sorting out fact from fiction and identifying research possibilitiesand practical applications are not easy. This issue brief is intended to help policymakers and administrators understand how analytics and data mining have been-and can be-applied for educational improvement. At present, educational data mining tends to focus on developing new tools for discovering patterns in data. These patterns are generally about the microconcepts involved in learning: one-digit multiplication, subtraction with carries, and so on. Learning analytics-at least as it is currently contrasted with data mining-focuses on applying tools and techniques at larger scales, such as in courses and at schools and postsecondary institutions. But both disciplines work with patterns and prediction: If we can discern the pattern in the data and make sense of what is happening, we can predict what should come next and take the appropriate action. Educational data mining and learning analytics are used to research and build models in several areas that can influence online learning systems. One area is user modeling, which encompasses what a learner knows, what a learner's behavior and motivation are, what the user experience is like, and how satisfied users are with online learning. At the simplest level, analytics can detect when a student in an online course is going astray and nudge him or her on to a course correction. At the most complex, they hold promise of detecting boredom from patterns of key clicks and redirecting the student's attention. Because these data are gathered in real time, there is a real possibility of continuous improvement via multiple feedback loops that operate at different time scales-immediate to the student for the next problem, daily to the teacher for the next day's teaching, monthly to the principal for judging progress, and annually to the district and state administrators for overall school improvement. The same kinds of data that inform user or learner models can be used to profile users. Profiling as used here means grouping similar users into categories using salient characteristics. These categories then can be used to offer experiences to groups of users or to make recommendations to the users and adaptations to how a system performs. User modeling and profiling are suggestive of real-time adaptations. In contrast, some applications of data mining and analytics are for more experimental purposes. Domain modeling is largely experimental with the goal of understanding how to present a topic and at what level of detail. The study of learning components and instructional principles also uses experimentation to understand what is effective at promoting learning. These examples suggest that the actions from data mining and analytics are always automatic, but that is less often the case. Visual data analyticsclosely involve humans to help make sense of data, from initial pattern detection and model building to sophisticated data dashboards that present data in a way that humans can act upon. K-12 schools and school districts are starting to adopt such institution-level analyses for detecting areas for instructional improvement, setting policies, and measuring results. Making visible students' learning and assessment activities opens up the possibility for students to develop skills in monitoring their own learning and to see directly how their effort improves their success. Teachers gain views into students' performance that help them adapt their teaching or initiate tutoring, tailored assignments, and the like. Robust applications of educational data mining and learning analytics techniques come with costs and challenges. Information technology (IT) departments will understand the costs associated with collecting and storing logged data, while algorithm developers will recognize the computational costs these techniques still require. Another technical challenge is that educational data systems are not interoperable, so bringing together administrative data and classroom-level data remains a challenge. Yet combining these data can give algorithms better predictive power. Combining data about student performance-online tracking, standardized tests, teachergenerated tests-to form one simplified picture of what a student knows can be difficult and must meet acceptable standards for validity. It also requires careful attention to student and teacher privacy and the ethical obligations associated with knowing and acting on student data. Educational data mining and learning analytics have the potential to make visible data that have heretofore gone unseen, unnoticed, and therefore unactionable. To help further the fields and gain value from their practical applications, the recommendations are that educators and administrators: ‚Ä¢ Develop a culture of using data for making instructional decisions. ‚Ä¢ Involve IT departments in planning for data collection and use. ‚Ä¢ Be smart data consumers who ask critical questions about commercial offerings and create demand for the most useful features and uses. ‚Ä¢ Start with focused areas where data will help, show success, and then expand to new areas. ‚Ä¢ Communicate with students and parents about where data come from and how the data are used. ‚Ä¢ Help align state policies with technical requirements for online learning systems.Researchers and software developers are encouraged to: ‚Ä¢ Conduct research on usability and effectiveness of data displays. ‚Ä¢ Help instructors be more effective in the classroom with more realtime and data-based decision support tools, including recommendation services. ‚Ä¢ Continue to research methods for using identified student information where it will help most, anonymizing data when required, and understanding how to align data across different systems. ‚Ä¢ Understand how to repurpose predictive models developed in one context to another. A final recommendation is to create and continue strong collaboration across research, commercial, and educational sectors. Commercial companies operate on fast development cycles and can produce data useful for research. Districts and schools want properly vetted learning environments. Effective partnerships can help these organizations codesign the best tools.},

The design was based largely on the literature on concepts and mechanisms of self-efficacy. A structured telephone survey was conducted with 30 program alumni from the inaugural school who were no longer in high school. Near-term effects, enduring effects, contextual considerations, and diffusion and dissemination were queried. Students reported high incoming attitudes toward STEM education and careers, and these attitudes showed before versus after gains (P \&lt; .05). Students in this modest sample overwhelmingly attributed elevated and enduring levels of impact on their interest and confidence in pursuing a science or healthcare-related career to the program. Additionally, 63\% subsequently took additional science or health courses, 73\% participated in a job or educational experience that was science related during high school, and 97\% went on to college. Four of every five program graduates cited a health-related college major, and 83\% offered their strongest recommendation of the program to others. Further study and evaluation of simulation-based experiences that capitalize on informal, naturalistic learning and promote self-efficacy are warranted.},

We find that the science identity positively impacts the likelihood of entering a science occupation. It also serves as a mediator for other factors that are related to educational success.

  abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning.

In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme.

In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning.

In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme.

@book{topol2016patient,
  abstract = {A trip to the doctor is almost a guarantee of misery. You'll make an appointment months in advance. You'll probably wait for several hours until you hear "the doctor will see you now"-but only for fifteen minutes! Then you'll wait even longer for lab tests, the results of which you'll likely never see, unless they indicate further (and more invasive) tests, most of which will probably prove unnecessary (much like physicals themselves). And your bill will be astronomical.

In The Patient Will See You Now, Eric Topol, one of the nation's top physicians, shows why medicine does not have to be that way. Instead, you could use your smartphone to get rapid test results from one drop of blood, monitor your vital signs both day and night, and use an artificially intelligent algorithm to receive a diagnosis without having to see a doctor, all at a small fraction of the cost imposed by our modern healthcare system.

The change is powered by what Topol calls medicine's "Gutenberg moment." Much as the printing press took learning out of the hands of a priestly class, the mobile internet is doing the same for medicine, giving us unprecedented control over our healthcare. With smartphones in hand, we are no longer beholden to an impersonal and paternalistic system in which "doctor knows best." Medicine has been digitized, Topol argues; now it will be democratized. Computers will replace physicians for many diagnostic tasks, citizen science will give rise to citizen medicine, and enormous data sets will give us new means to attack conditions that have long been incurable. Massive, open, online medicine, where diagnostics are done by Facebook-like comparisons of medical profiles, will enable real-time, real-world research on massive populations. There's no doubt the path forward will be complicated: the medical establishment will resist these changes, and digitized medicine inevitably raises serious issues surrounding privacy. Nevertheless, the result-better, cheaper, and more human health care-will be worth it.

Provocative and engrossing, The Patient Will See You Now is essential reading for anyone who thinks they deserve better health care. That is, for all of us.},

Currently, American students' performances and enthusiasm in STEM education are inadequate for the US to maintain its leadership in STEM professions unless the government takes more actions to motivate a new generation of US students towards STEM careers. Despite of coherent actions taken by the government and various institutions, the US cannot ensure the production of a sufficient number of experts in STEM fields to meet its national and global needs. The current situation is that the US is largely dependent on the foreign-born STEM workforce. This paper starts with a deeper look at the participation rate of American students in STEM careers and the basis of career choices by the US students. The discussion is driven by barriers and misconceptions about STEM education. It concludes with recommendations for how to motivate more US students to pursue STEM careers. },

  abstract = { The objectives of this article were to investigate to which extent and in what ways persons influence students' choice of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in tertiary education, and to assess the suitability of an analytical framework for describing this influence. In total, 5,007 Norwegian STEM students completed a questionnaire including multiple-choice as well as open-ended questions about sources of inspiration for their educational choice. Using the conceptualisation of significant persons suggested by Woelfel and Haller, the respondents' descriptions of parents and teachers are presented in order to elaborate on the different ways these significant persons influence a STEM-related educational choice. Parents engaged in STEM themselves are models, making the choice of STEM familiar, and they help youngsters define themselves through conversation and support, thus being definers. Teachers are models by displaying how STEM might bring fulfilment in someone's life and by giving pupils a positive experience with the subjects. They help young people discover their STEM abilities, thus being definers. Celebrities are reported to have minor influence on STEM-related educational choices. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that interpersonal relationships are key factors in order to inspire and motivate a choice of STEM education. Implications for recruitment issues and for research on interpersonal influence are discussed. It is suggested that initiatives to increase recruitment to STEM might be aimed at parents and other persons in interpersonal relationships with youth as a target group. },

@book{ingalls2013mathematical,
  abstract = {Systems techniques are integral to current research in molecular cell biology, and system-level investigations are often accompanied by mathematical models. These models serve as working hypotheses: they help us to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. This book offers an introduction to mathematical concepts and techniques needed for the construction and interpretation of models in molecular systems biology. It is accessible to upper-level undergraduate or graduate students in life science or engineering who have some familiarity with calculus, and will be a useful reference for researchers at all levels.

The first four chapters cover the basics of mathematical modeling in molecular systems biology. The last four chapters address specific biological domains, treating modeling of metabolic networks, of signal transduction pathways, of gene regulatory networks, and of electrophysiology and neuronal action potentials. Chapters 3--8 end with optional sections that address more specialized modeling topics.

@article{castillo2011adversarial,
  abstract = {Web search engines have become indispensable tools for finding content. As the popularity of the Web has increased, the efforts to exploit the Web for commercial, social, or political advantage have grown, making it harder for search engines to discriminate between truthful signals of content quality and deceptive attempts to game search engines' rankings. This problem is further complicated by the open nature of the Web, which allows anyone to write and publish anything, and by the fact that search engines must analyze ever-growing numbers of Web pages. Moreover, increasing expectations of users, who over time rely on Web search for information needs related to more aspects of their lives, further deepen the need for search engines to develop effective counter-measures against deception.

In this monograph, we consider the effects of the adversarial relationship between search systems and those who wish to manipulate them, a field known as "Adversarial Information Retrieval". We show that search engine spammers create false content and misleading links to lure unsuspecting visitors to pages filled with advertisements or malware. We also examine work over the past decade or so that aims to discover such spamming activities to get spam pages removed or their effect on the quality of the results reduced.

Research in Adversarial Information Retrieval has been evolving over time, and currently continues both in traditional areas (e.g., link spam) and newer areas, such as click fraud and spam in social media, demonstrating that this conflict is far from over.},

@article{goldberg2017neural,
  abstract = {Neural networks are a family of powerful machine learning models. This book focuses on the application of neural network models to natural language data. The first half of the book (Parts I and II) covers the basics of supervised machine learning and feed-forward neural networks, the basics of working with machine learning over language data, and the use of vector-based rather than symbolic representations for words. It also covers the computation-graph abstraction, which allows to easily define and train arbitrary neural networks, and is the basis behind the design of contemporary neural network software libraries.

The second part of the book (Parts III and IV) introduces more specialized neural network architectures, including 1D convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, conditioned-generation models, and attention-based models. These architectures and techniques are the driving force behind state-of-the-art algorithms for machine translation, syntactic parsing, and many other applications. Finally, we also discuss tree-shaped networks, structured prediction, and the prospects of multi-task learning.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the learning effectiveness and motivational appeal of a computer game for learning computer memory concepts, which was designed according to the curricular objectives and the subject matter of the Greek high school Computer Science (CS) curriculum, as compared to a similar application, encompassing identical learning objectives and content but lacking the gaming aspect. The study also investigated potential gender differences in the game‚Äôs learning effectiveness and motivational appeal. The sample was 88 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used the gaming application (Group A, N = 47) and the other one the non-gaming one (Group B, N = 41). A Computer Memory Knowledge Test (CMKT) was used as the pretest and posttest. Students were also observed during the interventions. Furthermore, after the interventions, students‚Äô views on the application they had used were elicited through a feedback questionnaire. Data analyses showed that the gaming approach was both more effective in promoting students‚Äô knowledge of computer memory concepts and more motivational than the non-gaming approach. Despite boys‚Äô greater involvement with, liking of and experience in computer gaming, and their greater initial computer memory knowledge, the learning gains that boys and girls achieved through the use of the game did not differ significantly, and the game was found to be equally motivational for boys and girls. The results suggest that within high school CS, educational computer games can be exploited as effective and motivational learning environments, regardless of students‚Äô gender.},

Nevertheless, as an inherently limited representation of a more complex information need, every query can arguably be considered ambiguous to some extent. In order to tackle query ambiguity, search result diversification approaches have recently been proposed to produce rankings aimed to satisfy the multiple possible information needs underlying a query. In this survey, we review the published literature on search result diversification. In particular, we discuss the motivations for diversifying the search results for an ambiguous query and provide a formal definition of the search result diversification problem. In addition, we describe the most successful approaches in the literature for producing and evaluating diversity in multiple search domains. Finally, we also discuss recent advances as well as open research directions in the field of search result diversification.},

  abstract = {Learning to rank for Information Retrieval (IR) is a task to automatically construct a ranking model using training data, such that the model can sort new objects according to their degrees of relevance, preference, or importance. Many IR problems are by nature ranking problems, and many IR technologies can be potentially enhanced by using learning-to-rank techniques. The objective of this tutorial is to give an introduction to this research direction. Specifically, the existing learning-to-rank algorithms are reviewed and categorized into three approaches: the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches. The advantages and disadvantages with each approach are analyzed, and the relationships between the loss functions used in these approaches and IR evaluation measures are discussed. Then the empirical evaluations on typical learning-to-rank methods are shown, with the LETOR collection as a benchmark dataset, which seems to suggest that the listwise approach be the most effective one among all the approaches. After that, a statistical ranking theory is introduced, which can describe different learning-to-rank algorithms, and be used to analyze their query-level generalization abilities. At the end of the tutorial, we provide a summary and discuss potential future work on learning to rank.},

@book{pearl2009causality,
  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

  abstract = {The formalism of probabilistic graphical models provides a unifying framework for capturing complex dependencies among random variables, and building large-scale multivariate statistical models. Graphical models have become a focus of research in many statistical, computational and mathematical fields, including bioinformatics, communication theory, statistical physics, combinatorial optimization, signal and image processing, information retrieval and statistical machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances ‚Äî including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions ‚Äî are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, we develop general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. We describe how a wide variety of algorithms ‚Äî among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, max-product and linear programming relaxation, as well as conic programming relaxations ‚Äî can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

@article{barnickel2014large,
  abstract = {To reduce the increasing amount of time spent on literature search in the life sciences, several methods for automated knowledge extraction have been developed. Co-occurrence based approaches can deal with large text corpora like MEDLINE in an acceptable time but are not able to extract any specific type of semantic relation. Semantic relation extraction methods based on syntax trees, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and the interpretation of the generated trees is difficult. Several natural language processing (NLP) approaches for the biomedical domain exist focusing specifically on the detection of a limited set of relation types. For systems biology, generic approaches for the detection of a multitude of relation types which in addition are able to process large text corpora are needed but the number of systems meeting both requirements is very limited. We introduce the use of SENNA (‚ÄúSemantic Extraction using a Neural Network Architecture‚Äù), a fast and accurate neural network based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) program, for the large scale extraction of semantic relations from the biomedical literature. A comparison of processing times of SENNA and other SRL systems or syntactical parsers used in the biomedical domain revealed that SENNA is the fastest Proposition Bank (PropBank) conforming SRL program currently available. 89 million biomedical sentences were tagged with SENNA on a 100 node cluster within three days. The accuracy of the presented relation extraction approach was evaluated on two test sets of annotated sentences resulting in precision/recall values of 0.71/0.43. We show that the accuracy as well as processing speed of the proposed semantic relation extraction approach is sufficient for its large scale application on biomedical text. The proposed approach is highly generalizable regarding the supported relation types and appears to be especially suited for general-purpose, broad-scale text mining systems. The presented approach bridges the gap between fast, cooccurrence-based approaches lacking semantic relations and highly specialized and computationally demanding NLP approaches.},

It‚Äôs their power to build a cadre of employees who have great inner work lives‚Äîconsistently positive emotions; strong motivation; and favorable perceptions of the organization, their work, and their colleagues. The worst managers undermine inner work life, often unwittingly.

As Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer explain in The Progress Principle, seemingly mundane workday events can make or break employees‚Äô inner work lives. But it‚Äôs forward momentum in meaningful work‚Äîprogress‚Äîthat creates the best inner work lives. Through rigorous analysis of nearly 12,000 diary entries provided by 238 employees in 7 companies, the authors explain how managers can foster progress and enhance inner work life every day.

The book shows how to remove obstacles to progress, including meaningless tasks and toxic relationships. It also explains how to activate two forces that enable progress: (1) catalysts‚Äîevents that directly facilitate project work, such as clear goals and autonomy‚Äîand (2) nourishers‚Äîinterpersonal events that uplift workers, including encouragement and demonstrations of respect and collegiality.

Brimming with honest examples from the companies studied, The Progress Principle equips aspiring and seasoned leaders alike with the insights they need to maximize their people‚Äôs performance.},

@article{pearl2010introduction,
  abstract = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

In the current study (N = 96), we assessed 6-year-old children‚Äôs stereotypes about STEM fields and tested an intervention to develop girls‚Äô STEM motivation despite these stereotypes. First-grade children held stereotypes that boys were better than girls at robotics and programming but did not hold these stereotypes about math and science. Girls with stronger stereotypes about robotics and programming reported lower interest and self-efficacy in these domains. We experimentally tested whether positive experience with programming robots would lead to greater interest and self-efficacy among girls despite these stereotypes. Children were randomly assigned either to a treatment group that was given experience in programming a robot using a smartphone or to control groups (no activity or other activity). Girls given programming experience reported higher technology interest and self-efficacy compared with girls without this experience and did not exhibit a significant gender gap relative to boys‚Äô interest and self-efficacy. These findings show that children‚Äôs views mirror current American cultural messages about who excels at computer science and engineering and show the benefit of providing young girls with chances to experience technological activities.},

This article provides a historical overview of deep learning and focus on its applications in object recognition, detection, and segmentation, which are key challenges of computer vision and have numerous applications to images and videos. The discussed research topics on object recognition include image classification on ImageNet, face recognition, and video classification. The detection part covers general object detection on ImageNet, pedestrian detection, face landmark detection (face alignment), and human landmark detection (pose estimation). On the segmentation side, the article discusses the most recent progress on scene labeling, semantic segmentation, face parsing, human parsing and saliency detection. Object recognition is considered as whole-image classification, while detection and segmentation are pixelwise classification tasks. Their fundamental differences will be discussed in this article. Fully convolutional neural networks and highly efficient forward and backward propagation algorithms specially designed for pixelwise classification task will be introduced. The covered application domains are also much diversified. Human and face images have regular structures, while general object and scene images have much more complex variations in geometric structures and layout. Videos include the temporal dimension. Therefore, they need to be processed with different deep models. All the selected domain applications have received tremendous attentions in the computer vision and multimedia communities. Through concrete examples of these applications, we explain the key points which make deep learning outperform conventional computer vision systems. (1) Different than traditional pattern recognition systems, which heavily rely on manually designed features, deep learning automatically learns hierarchical feature representations from massive training data and disentangles hidden factors of input data through multi-level nonlinear mappings. (2) Different than existing pattern recognition systems which sequentially design or train their key components, deep learning is able to jointly optimize all the components and crate synergy through close interactions among them. (3) While most machine learning models can be approximated with neural networks with shallow structures, for some tasks, the expressive power of deep models increases exponentially as their architectures go deep. Deep models are especially good at learning global contextual feature representation with their deep structures. (4) Benefitting from the large learning capacity of deep models, some classical computer vision challenges can be recast as high-dimensional data transform problems and can be solved from new perspectives. Finally, some open questions and future works regarding to deep learning in object recognition, detection, and segmentation will be discussed.

As a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning has achieved impressive success on solving grand challenges in many fields including speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, image and video processing, and multimedia. This monograph provides a historical overview of deep learning and focuses on its applications in object recognition, detection, and segmentation, which are key challenges of computer vision and have numerous applications to images and videos.

@book{goodfellow2016learning,
  abstract = {Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

Chiefly, we argue, such NLP activity is the only way up to a defensible notion of meaning at conceptual levels (in the original SW diagram) based on lower level empirical computations over usage. Our aim is definitely not to claim logic-bad, NLP-good in any simple-minded way, but to argue that the SW will be a fascinating interaction of these two methodologies, again like the WWW (which has been basically a field for statistical NLP research) but with deeper content. Only NLP technologies (and chiefly information extraction) will be able to provide the requisite RDF knowledge stores for the SW from existing unstructured text databases in the WWW, and in the vast quantities needed. There is no alternative at this point, since a wholly or mostly hand-crafted SW is also unthinkable, as is a SW built from scratch and without reference to the WWW. We also assume that, whatever the limitations on current SW representational power we have drawn attention to here, the SW will continue to grow in a distributed manner so as to serve the needs of scientists, even if it is not perfect.

Natural Language Processing as a Foundation of the Semantic Web argues that Natural Language Processing (NLP) does, and will continue to, underlie the Semantic Web (SW), including its initial construction from unstructured sources like the World Wide Web, in several different ways, and whether its advocates realise this or not.

The claim being made is definitely not logic-bad, NLP-good in any simple-minded way, but that the SW will be a fascinating interaction of these two methodologies, like the WWW (which, as the authors explain, has been a fruitful field for statistical NLP research) but with deeper content.

  abstract = {Like most good educational interventions, problem-based learning (PBL) did not grow out of theory, but out of a practical problem. Medical students were bored, dropping out, and unable to apply what they had learned in lectures to their practical experiences a couple of years later. Neurologist Howard S. Barrows reversed the sequence, presenting students with patient problems to solve in small groups and requiring them to seek relevant knowledge in an effort to solve those problems. Out of his work, PBL was born.The book is divided into four sections, each containing contributions by leaders in the field. Chapters in the first section focus on the structure of PBL and the critical elements of the approach. Articulating the underlying problems to be addressed, the role of facilitators, and the process to be followed in achieving a successful PBL intervention are all discussed. The second section explores how PBL has been adapted to function in areas outside medicine, from climate science to teacher education, while the third section explores how the methodology has been combined with other approaches to teaching and learning, such as learning by design and project-based learning. The fourth section assesses the impact of PBL techniques on improving both research and teaching. An epilogue speculates about the future of PBL, synthesizing contributions from the previous chapters and suggesting key themes for further exploration},

  abstract = {Question answering aims to develop techniques that can go beyond the retrieval of relevant documents in order to return exact answers to natural language questions, such as ‚ÄúHow tall is the Eiffel Tower?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhich cities have a subway system?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWho is Alberto Tomba?‚Äù. Answering natural language questions requires more complex processing of text than employed by current information retrieval systems. A number of question answering systems have been developed which are capable of carrying out the processing required to achieve high levels of accuracy. However, little work has been reported on techniques for quickly finding exact answers.


This thesis investigates a number of novel techniques for performing open-domain question answering. Investigated techniques include: manual and automatically constructed question analysers, document retrieval specifically for question answering, semantic type answer extraction, answer extraction via automatically acquired surface matching text patterns, principled target processing combined with document retrieval for definition questions, and various approaches to sentence simplification which aid in the generation of concise definitions.


The novel techniques in this thesis are combined to create two end-to-end question answering systems which allow answers to be found quickly. AnswerFinder answers factoid questions such as ‚ÄúWhen was Mozart born?‚Äù, whilst Varro builds definitions for terms such as ‚Äúaspirin‚Äù, ‚ÄúAaron Copland‚Äù, and ‚Äúgolden parachute‚Äù. Both systems allow users to find answers to their questions using web documents retrieved by Google‚Ñ¢. Together these two systems demonstrate that the techniques developed in this thesis can be successfully used to provide quick effective open-domain question answering.},

This study used latent profile analysis to mimic higher-order interactions to identify homogenous personality profiles using the FFM, and also examined relationships between resultant profiles and affect, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and coping efficacy. Participants (N = 371) completed self-report and daily diary questionnaires. A 3-profile solution provided the best fit to the data; the profiles were characterized as well-adjusted, reserved, and excitable. The well-adjusted group reported better psychological functioning in validation analyses. The reserved and excitable groups differed on anxiety, with the excitable group reporting generally higher anxiety than the reserved group. Latent profile analysis may be a parsimonious way to model personality heterogeneity.},

@book{pinker2010language,
  abstract = {A three-year-old toddler is "a grammatical genius"--master of most constructions, obeying adult rules of language. To Pinker, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology psycholinguist, the explanation for this miracle is that language is an instinct, an evolutionary adaptation that is partly "hard-wired" into the brain and partly learned. In this exciting synthesis--an entertaining, totally accessible study that will regale language lovers and challenge professionals in many disciplines--Pinker builds a bridge between "innatists" like MIT linguist Noam Chomsky, who hold that infants are biologically programmed for language, and "social interactionists" who contend that they acquire it largely from the environment. If Pinker is right, the origins of language go much further back than 30,000 years ago (the date most commonly given in textbooks)--perhaps to Homo habilis , who lived 2.5 million years ago, or even eons earlier. Peppered with mind-stretching language exercises, the narrative first unravels how babies learn to talk and how people make sense of speech. Professor and co-director of MIT's Center for Cognitive Science, Pinker demolishes linguistic determinism, which holds that differences among languages cause marked differences in the thoughts of their speakers. He then follows neurolinguists in their quest for language centers in the brain and for genes that might help build brain circuits controlling grammar and speech. Pinker also argues that claims for chimpanzees' acquisition of language (via symbols or American Sign Language) are vastly exaggerated and rest on skimpy data. Finally, he takes delightful swipes at "language mavens" like William Safire and Richard Lederer, accusing them of rigidity and of grossly underestimating the average person's language skills. Pinker's book is a beautiful hymn to the infinite creative potential of language.},

The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package -- PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit) -- that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

  abstract = {Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) fields typically have not been successful at recruiting or retaining women students. Research indicates several reasons for this shortage but mainly from three perspectives: social issues, exposure/prior knowledge and curriculum issues in K-12 settings. This mixed-methods research addresses a gap in the literature by investigating the motivation and self-regulation behaviors of successful female students who are studying computer science and computer engineering. The findings in phase one of this study indicated that learning and performance approach goals predicted adaptive strategic self-regulation behaviors including strategy use, knowledge building and engagement. Learning avoidance goals predicted lack of regulation. Task approach goals predicted knowledge building and engagement (each negatively) and task avoid goals predicted strategy use, knowledge building and engagement (each negatively). Engagement positively predicted course grades while lack of regulation negatively predicted course grades. Learning avoidance had a significant negative indirect effect on course grades through lack of regulation. Learning approach was associated with better regulation (i.e., lower lack of regulation) and higher grades. Performance approach had a significant positive indirect effect on course grades through engagement. Performance avoidance had a significant negative indirect effect on course grades
through lack of regulation. Task avoidance had a significant negative indirect effect on course grades through engagement. Task approach, contrary to the hypothesized direct of effect, had a significant negative indirect effect on course grades through engagement.

Four themes emerged during the qualitative phase of this study. These included: The Gender Effect (students gender impacted their behavior and confidence), Lack of CS \& CE experience (students' prior knowledge impacted how they studied and how competent they felt), Key Influences (students were influenced by the work and academic environment, family members, classmates and professors) and Problem Solvers (students responded to the rigor of the program by being aggressive problem solvers). This research has implications for how we can support other female students who have the potential or desire to excel in computing fields. K-12 school systems and undergraduate programs should take steps to create intentional programming that introduce, educate and help female students persist in computer science and computer engineering programs. Educators and parents should engage female students in math and science coursework and extracurricular activities early in life, especially where formal CS or CE programs do not exist.},

  abstract = {Linear algebra has in recent years become an essential part of the mathematical background required by
mathematicians and mathematics teachers, engineers, computer scientists, physicists, economists, and
statisticians, among others. This requirement reflects the importance and wide applications of the subject
matter.
This book is designed for use as a textbook for a formal course in linear algebra or as a supplement to all
current standard texts. It aims to present an introduction to linear algebra which will be found helpful to all
readers regardless of their fields of specification. More material has been included than can be covered in most
first courses. This has been done to make the book more flexible, to provide a useful book of reference, and to
stimulate further interest in the subject.
Each chapter begins with clear statements of pertinent definitions, principles, and theorems together with
illustrative and other descriptive material. This is followed by graded sets of solved and supplementary
problems. The solved problems serve to illustrate and amplify the theory, and to provide the repetition of basic
principles so vital to effective learning. Numerous proofs, especially those of all essential theorems, are
included among the solved problems. The supplementary problems serve as a complete review of the material
of each chapter.
The first three chapters treat vectors in Euclidean space, matrix algebra, and systems of linear equations.
These chapters provide the motivation and basic computational tools for the abstract investigations of vector
spaces and linear mappings which follow. After chapters on inner product spaces and orthogonality and on
determinants, there is a detailed discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors giving conditions for representing
a linear operator by a diagonal matrix. This naturally leads to the study of various canonical forms,
specifically, the triangular, Jordan, and rational canonical forms. Later chapters cover linear functions and
the dual space V*, and bilinear, quadratic, and Hermitian forms. The last chapter treats linear operators on
inner product spaces.
The main changes in the fourth edition have been in the appendices. First of all, we have expanded
Appendix A on the tensor and exterior products of vector spaces where we have now included proofs on the
existence and uniqueness of such products. We also added appendices covering algebraic structures, including
modules, and polynomials over a field. Appendix D, ‚Äò‚ÄòOdds and Ends,‚Äô‚Äô includes the Moore‚ÄìPenrose
generalized inverse which appears in various applications, such as statistics. There are also many additional
solved and supplementary problems.},

In Study 1, women STEM graduate students perceived they exerted more effort than peers to succeed. For women, but not men, this effort expenditure perception predicted a decreased sense of belonging, which in turn decreased motivation. Study 2 tested whether the male-dominated status of a field triggers such effort expectations. We created a fictional ``eco-psychology'' graduate program, which when depicted as male-dominated resulted in women expecting to exert relatively more effort and decreased their interest in pursuing the field. Study 3 found emphasizing effort as expected (and normal) to achieve success elevated women's feelings of belonging and future motivation. Results suggest effort expenditure perceptions are an indicator women use to assess their fit in STEM. Implications for enhancing women's participation in STEM are discussed.},

AquaLog is a portable question-answering system which takes queries expressed in natural language and an ontology as input and returns answers drawn from the available semantic markup. We say that AquaLog is portable, because the configuration time required to customize the system for a particular ontology is negligible. AquaLog combines several powerful techniques in a novel way to make sense of NL queries and to map them to semantic markup. Moreover it also includes a learning component, which ensures that the performance of the system improves over time, in response to the particular community jargon used by the end users. In this paper we describe the current version of the system, in particular discussing its portability, its reasoning capabilities, and its learning mechanism.},

  abstract = {Nationally, the need for an increase in interest, enrollment, and degrees awarded from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degree programs continues to suffer. While students are enrolling in collegiate STEM degree programs, it is not occurring at a rate that meets the workforce demand. In addition to the concern that there is not a sufficient amount of collegiate STEM majors, there is a concern over too few females enrolling and persisting in collegiate STEM degree programs.

This mixed methods sequential exploratory research study considered the factors that influence and motivate undergraduate female students to enroll and persist in collegiate STEM degree programs. The research study was conducted in four phases. The first phase of the study focused on exploring the factors that influenced first-year female freshmen to enroll in a collegiate STEM degree program. Qualitative data were collected from undergraduate females enrolled in a STEM degree program. The second phase, instrument development, involved developing a survey instrument that consisted of 15 questions. The survey included a combination of (a) the Motivated Student Learning Questionnaire, (b) the questions developed from the findings from the qualitative phase, and (c) a demographic section. In the third phase of the research study, quantitative data collection, the survey instrument was administered to a sample of undergraduate female STEM majors. The fourth phase integrated the findings from the qualitative and quantitative phases.


Five factors were considered as being significant to undergraduate female STEM majors when choosing a collegiate degree program: (a) helping others in their career, (b) having access to pre-collegiate STEM exposure, (c) obtaining information about STEM career pathways, (d) establishing relationships with influential stakeholders, and (e) developing confidence in math and science. The findings from this study illustrate the role of K-12 STEM educators, pre-collegiate STEM outreach programs, and STEM education policymakers in influencing and motivating female students to enroll and persist in collegiate STEM degree programs.},

@article{li2014semantic,
  abstract = {Relevance is the most important factor to assure users‚Äô satisfaction in search and the success of a search engine heavily depends on its performance on relevance. It has been observed that most of the dissatisfaction cases in relevance are due to term mismatch between queries and documents (e.g., query ‚ÄúNY times‚Äù does not match well with a document only containing ‚ÄúNew York Times‚Äù), because term matching, i.e., the bag-of-words approach, still functions as the main mechanism of modern search engines. It is not exaggerated to say, therefore, that mismatch between query and document poses the most critical challenge in search. Ideally, one would like to see query and document match with each other, if they are topically relevant. Recently, researchers have expended significant effort to address the problem. The major approach is to conduct semantic matching, i.e., to perform more query and document understanding to represent the meanings of them, and perform better matching between the enriched query and document representations. With the availability of large amounts of log data and advanced machine learning techniques, this becomes more feasible and significant progress has been made recently. This survey gives a systematic and detailed introduction to newly developed machine learning technologies for query document matching (semantic matching) in search, particularly web search. It focuses on the fundamental problems, as well as the state-of-the-art solutions of query document matching on form aspect, phrase aspect, word sense aspect, topic aspect, and structure aspect. The ideas and solutions explained may motivate industrial practitioners to turn the research results into products. The methods introduced and the discussions made may also stimulate academic researchers to find new research directions and approaches. Matching between query and document is not limited to search and similar problems can be found in question answering, online advertising, cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, recommender systems, link prediction, image annotation, drug design, and other applications, as the general task of matching between objects from two different spaces. The technologies introduced can be generalized into more general machine learning techniques, which is referred to as learning to match in this survey.},

This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.

The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.

  abstract = {In experimental work e.g. in physics one often encounters problems where a standard statistical probability density function is applicable. It is often of great help to be able to handle these in different ways such as calculating probability contents or generating random numbers. For these purposes there are excellent text-books in statistics e.g. the classical work of Maurice G. Kendall and Alan Stuart [1,2] or more modern text-books as [3] and others. Some books are particularly aimed at experimental physics or even specifically at particle physics [4,5,6,7,8]. Concerning numerical methods a valuable references worth mentioning is [9] which has been surpassed by a new edition [10]. Also hand-books, especially [11], has been of great help throughout. However, when it comes to actual applications it often turns out to be hard to find detailed explanations in the literature ready for implementation. This work has been collected over many years in parallel with actual experimental work. In this way some material may be ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù and sometimes be na¬®ƒ±ve and have somewhat clumsy solutions not always made in the mathematically most stringent may. We apologize for this but still hope that it will be of interest and help for people who is struggling to find methods to solve their statistical problems in making real applications and not only learning statistics as a course. Even if one has the skill and may be able to find solutions it seems worthwhile to have easy and fast access to formul√¶ ready for application. Similar books and reports exist e.g. [12,13] but we hope the present work may compete in describing more distributions, being more complete, and including more explanations on relations given. The material could most probably have been divided in a more logical way but we have chosen to present the distributions in alphabetic order. In this way it is more of a hand-book than a proper text-book. After the first release the report has been modestly changed. Minor changes to correct misprints is made whenever found. In a few cases subsections and tables have been added. These alterations are described on page 182. In October 1998 the first somewhat bigger revision was made where in particular a lot of material on the non-central sampling distributions were added.},

The context depends on the type of advertising and could mean ‚Äì content where the ad is shown, the user who is viewing the ad or the social network of the user. Computational Advertising (CA) is a scientific sub-discipline at the intersection of information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, large scale search and text analysis. The core problem addressed in Computational Advertising is of match-making between the ads and the context.

CA is prevalent in three major forms on the Web. One of the forms involves showing textual ads relevant to a query on the search page, known as Sponsored Search. On the other hand, showing textual ads relevant to a third party webpage content is known as Contextual Advertising. The third form of advertising also deals with the placement of ads on third party Web pages, but the ads in this form are rich multimedia ads ‚Äì image, video, audio, flash. The business model with rich media ads is slightly different from the ones with textual ads. These ads are also called banner ads, and this form of advertising is known as Display Advertising.

Both Sponsored Search and Contextual Advertising involve retrieving relevant ads for different types of content (query and Web page). As ads are short and are mainly written to attract the user, retrieval of ads pose challenges like vocabulary mismatch between the query/content and the ad. Also, as the user‚Äôs probability of examining an ad decreases with the position of the ad in the ranked list, it is imperative to keep the best ads at the top positions. Display Advertising poses several challenges including modeling user behaviour and noisy page content and bid optimization on the advertiser‚Äôs side. Additionally, online advertising faces challenges like false bidding, click spam and ad spam. These challenges are prevalent in all forms of advertising. There has been a lot of research work published in different areas of CA in the last one and a half decade. The focus of this survey is to discuss the problems and solutions pertaining to the information retrieval, machine learning and statistics domain of CA. This survey covers techniques and approaches that deal with several issues mentioned above.

Research in Computational Advertising has evolved over time and currently continues both in traditional areas (vocabulary mismatch, query rewriting, click prediction) and recently identified areas (user targeting, mobile advertising, social advertising). In this study, we predominantly focus on the problems and solutions proposed in traditional areas in detail and briefly cover the emerging areas in the latter half of the survey. To facilitate future research, a discussion of available resources, list of public benchmark datasets and future directions of work is also provided in the end.},

Project INSITE, a four-year professional development effort in Indiana, was designed to help teachers integrate problem-centered science methods in their classrooms. This approach was characterized by use of a meaningful driving question anchored in a real-world context; student-conducted investigations that resulted in the creation of products; collaboration among students, teachers, and the community; and use of technology as a tool for gathering and sharing information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the project suggest that it was generally successful in promoting positive teacher perceptions, fostering learner-centered classroom approaches, and leading to implementation of inquiry-based science in many classrooms.},

@article{kanhabua2015temporal,
  abstract = {Temporal dynamics and how they impact upon various components of information retrieval (IR) systems have received a large share of attention in the last decade. In particular, the study of relevance in information retrieval can now be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches, which explain how user behavior, document content and scale vary with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrieval effectiveness. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches, centered on the following questions: what are temporal dynamics, why do they occur, and when and how to leverage temporal information throughout the search cycle and architecture. We first explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. Next, we pinpoint several research issues and the impact of such temporal characteristics on search, essentially regarding processing dynamic content, temporal query analysis and time-aware ranking. We also address particular aspects of temporal information extraction (for instance, how to timestamp documents and generate temporal profiles of text). To this end, we present existing temporal search engines and applications in related research areas, e.g., exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction, where the time dimension also plays an important role.},

@article{ginsca2015credibility,
  abstract = {Credibility, as the general concept covering trustworthiness and expertise, but also quality and reliability, is strongly debated in philosophy, psychology, and sociology, and its adoption in computer science is therefore fraught with difficulties. Yet its importance has grown in the information access community because of two complementing factors: on one hand, it is relatively difficult to precisely point to the source of a piece of information, and on the other hand, complex algorithms, statistical machine learning, artificial intelligence, make decisions on behalf of the users, with little oversight from the users themselves. This survey presents a detailed analysis of existing credibility models from different information seeking research areas, with focus on the Web and its pervasive social component. It shows that there is a very rich body of work pertaining to different aspects and interpretations of credibility, particularly for different types of textual content (e.g., Web sites, blogs, tweets), but also to other modalities (videos, images, audio) and topics (e.g., health care). After an introduction placing credibility in the context of other sciences and relating it to trust, we argue for a quartic decomposition of credibility: expertise and trustworthiness, well documented in the literature and predominantly related to information source, and quality and reliability, raised to the status of equal partners because the source is often impossible to detect, and predominantly related to the content. The second half of the survey provides the reader with access points to the literature, grouped by research interests. Section 3 reviews general research directions: the factors that contribute to credibility assessment in human consumers of information; the models used to combine these factors; the methods to predict credibility. A smaller section is dedicated to informing users about the credibility learned from the data. Sections 4, 5, and 6 go further into details, with domain-specific credibility, social media credibility, and multimedia credibility, respectively. While each of them is best understood in the context of Sections 1 and 2, they can be read independently of each other. The last section of this survey addresses a topic not commonly considered under ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù: the credibility of the system itself, independent of the data creators. This is a topic of particular importance in domains where the user is professionally motivated and where there are no concerns about the credibility of the data (e.g. e-discovery and patent search). While there is little explicit work in this direction, we argue that this is an open research direction that is worthy of future exploration. Finally, as an additional help to the reader, an appendix lists the existing test collections that cater specifically to some aspect of credibility. Overall, this review will provide the reader with an organised and comprehensive reference guide to the state of the art and the problems at hand, rather than a final answer to the question of what credibility is for computer science. Even within the relatively limited scope of an exact science, such an answer is not possible for a concept that is itself widely debated in philosophy and social sciences.},

  abstract = {"Success in the new healthcare industry demands deep and profound strategic changes Healthcare Disrupted is a guide to developing vital new operating and business models in the healthcare industry's fast-changing landscape. Based on original research conducted by Accenture, this book explains how the biggest industry trends--consumer-focused care; value- and outcomes-based reimbursement; new digital consumers; the use of big data and advanced analytics; and rising numbers of strategic, collaborative, and inventive partnerships--are compelling biopharmaceutical and medical technology companies to change, and the implications of those changes on the rest of the industry. This book provides an informed, insightful view of the current state of the healthcare industry, as well as insight on what's to come. It digs deep into the issues to examine why and how established companies, and those new to the industry, must evolve to keep pace. It demonstrates how real-world data (from Electronic Medical Records, health wearables, the health Internet of Things (IoT), digital media, social media, and other sources) is combining with scalable technologies and advanced analytics to fundamentally change how healthcare is delivered. Healthcare Disrupted also reveals how this shift in healthcare delivery significantly improves patient and economic outcomes. The health care industry is increasingly focusing on: the patient as a partner; patient outcomes; and the quality, convenience, and affordability of care management. But does the industry really understand the implications of this shift in focus? To lead, and to thrive, many organizations will need to change their definition of innovation. They will need to lessen the time and lower the cost from discovery to market, and ensure the drugs they develop deliver a better patient outcome at an economically viable cost. This book provides practical insights on getting ahead of the curve by: Discovering how profoundly the healthcare industry is changing Finding your organization's place in the new order of modern health care Learning how to survive in the face of transformational trends Evolving your strategies for innovation, testing, providing care, and more The industry is turning toward an overall system in which value and patient outcomes are rewarded over volume, and performance is measured accordingly. Healthcare Disrupted shows how to adapt and stay relevant in the new age of digital medicine"--},

This paper reports on findings from the English University site. Key elements of creative teaching in this site were having a passion for the subject and for using sensitised pedagogical strategies, driven by an awareness of student perspective and relationship. Crucial goals were fostering independent thinking; striving for equality through conversation and collaboration; and orchestrating for knowledge-building.

  abstract = {Spam is information crafted to be delivered to a large number of recipients, in spite of their wishes. A spam filter is an automated tool to recognize spam so as to prevent its delivery. The purposes of spam and spam filters are diametrically opposed: spam is effective if it evades filters, while a filter is effective if it recognizes spam. The circular nature of these definitions, along with their appeal to the intent of sender and recipient make them difficult to formalize. A typical email user has a working definition no more formal than "I know it when I see it." Yet, current spam filters are remarkably effective, more effective than might be expected given the level of uncertainty and debate over a formal definition of spam, more effective than might be expected given the state-of-the-art information retrieval and machine learning methods for seemingly similar problems. But are they effective enough? Which are better? How might they be improved? Will their effectiveness be compromised by more cleverly crafted spam?

We survey current and proposed spam filtering techniques with particular emphasis on how well they work. Our primary focus is spam filtering in email; Similarities and differences with spam filtering in other communication and storage media ‚Äî such as instant messaging and the Web ‚Äî are addressed peripherally. In doing so we examine the definition of spam, the user's information requirements and the role of the spam filter as one component of a large and complex information universe. Well-known methods are detailed sufficiently to make the exposition self-contained, however, the focus is on considerations unique to spam. Comparisons, wherever possible, use common evaluation measures, and control for differences in experimental setup. Such comparisons are not easy, as benchmarks, measures, and methods for evaluating spam filters are still evolving. We survey these efforts, their results and their limitations. In spite of recent advances in evaluation methodology, many uncertainties (including widely held but unsubstantiated beliefs) remain as to the effectiveness of spam filtering techniques and as to the validity of spam filter evaluation methods. We outline several uncertainties and propose experimental methods to address them.

More specifically the intent of this report is to:

‚óè Describe how the programs were designed
‚óè Document what the programs accomplished
‚óè Summarize program evaluation methods used

Programs were selected for inclusion in this report if they met all of the following criteria:

I. Program Design Criteria

A. Designed to increase student interest in STEM

B. Employed practices that research indicates are effective in affecting STEM interest, such as:

	o Content was related to real-world application, ideally through hands-on learning
	o Critical thinking, collaboration, and small group work was encouraged
	o Caring adults (i.e., parents, teachers or STEM professionals) participated
	 Information about STEM career opportunities was provided

II. Program Outcome Criteria

A. Provided data on student interest in STEM
B. Assessed changes in STEM interest in relation to program participation
C. Assessed interest in STEM more generally, beyond the program itself
D. Collected student interest data directly from students

Programs funded by the STEM Pipeline during the 2009-2010 year (whether by the 2007 Networks Grants or by the 2008 Student Interest Grants) were considered for inclusion. The review included all current and historical materials submitted to the Department of Higher Education as part of a statewide evaluation process, as well as reports completed by local evaluators. Frequently, a single organization implemented two or three programs with different approaches and objectives and local evaluators conducted tailored evaluations specifically for each program. As a result, each program was considered separately for inclusion in this report.},

@book{roelleke2013information,
  abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) models are a core component of IR research and IR systems. The past decade brought a consolidation of the family of IR models, which by 2000 consisted of relatively isolated views on TF-IDF (Term-Frequency times Inverse-Document-Frequency) as the weighting scheme in the vector-space model (VSM), the probabilistic relevance framework (PRF), the binary independence retrieval (BIR) model, BM25 (Best-Match Version 25, the main instantiation of the PRF/BIR), and language modelling (LM). Also, the early 2000s saw the arrival of divergence from randomness (DFR).

Regarding intuition and simplicity, though LM is clear from a probabilistic point of view, several people stated: "It is easy to understand TF-IDF and BM25. For LM, however, we understand the math, but we do not fully understand why it works."

This book takes a horizontal approach gathering the foundations of TF-IDF, PRF, BIR, Poisson, BM25, LM, probabilistic inference networks (PIN's), and divergence-based models. The aim is to create a consolidated and balanced view on the main models.

A particular focus of this book is on the "relationships between models." This includes an overview over the main frameworks (PRF, logical IR, VSM, generalized VSM) and a pairing of TF-IDF with other models. It becomes evident that TF-IDF and LM measure the same, namely the dependence (overlap) between document and query. The Poisson probability helps to establish probabilistic, non-heuristic roots for TF-IDF, and the Poisson parameter, average term frequency, is a binding link between several retrieval models and model parameters.},

  abstract = {In The Patient Revolution, author Krisa Tailor‚Äîa noted expert in health care innovation and management‚Äîexplores, through the lens of design thinking, how information technology will take health care into the experience economy. In the experience economy, patients will shift to being empowered consumers who are active participants in their own care. Tailor explores this shift by creating a vision for a newly designed health care system that's focused on both sickness and wellness, and is driven by data and analytics. The new system seamlessly integrates health into our daily lives, and delivers care so uniquely personalized that no two people are provided identical treatments. Connected through data, everyone across the health care ecosystem, including clinicians, insurers, and researchers, will be able to meet individuals wherever they are in their health journey to reach the ultimate goal of keeping people healthy.

The patient revolution has just begun and an exciting journey awaits us.

Praise for the patient revolution

"A full 50% of the US population has at least one chronic disease that requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. Our current health care system is woefully inadequate in providing these individuals with the treatment and support they need. This disparity can only be addressed through empowering patients to better care for themselves and giving providers better tools to care for their patients. Both of those solutions will require the development and application of novel technologies. In Krisa Tailor's book The Patient Revolution, a blueprint is articulated for how this could be achieved, culminating in a vision for a learning health system within 10 years."

‚ÄîRicky Bloomfield, MD, Director, Mobile Technology Strategy; Assistant Professor, Duke Medicine

"In The Patient Revolution, Krisa Tailor astutely points out that 80% of health is impacted by factors outside of the health care system. Amazon unfortunately knows more about our patients than we do. The prescriptive analytics she describes will allow health care providers to use big data to optimize interventions at the level of the individual patient. The use of analytics will allow providers to improve quality, shape care coordination, and contain costs. Advanced analytics will lead to personalized care and ultimately empowered patients!"

"Excellent read. For me, health care represents a unique economy‚Äîone focused on technology, but requiring a deep understanding of humanity. Ms. Tailor begins the exploration of how we provide care via the concepts of design thinking, asking how we might redesign care with an eye toward changing the experience. She does an excellent job deconstructing this from the patient experience. I look forward to a hopeful follow-up directed at changing the provider culture."

‚ÄîAlan Pitt, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Avizia

"Whether you're a health care provider looking to gain an understanding of the health care landscape, a health data scientist, or a seasoned business pro, you'll come away with a deeper, nuanced understanding of today's evolving health care system with this book. Krisa Tailor ties together‚Äîin a comprehensive, unique way‚Äîthe worlds of health care administration, clinical practice, design thinking, and business strategy and innovation."

@article{kiryakov2004semantic,
  abstract = {The Semantic Web realization depends on the availability of a critical mass of metadata for the web content, associated with the respective formal knowledge about the world. We claim that the Semantic Web, at its current stage of development, is in a state of a critical need of metadata generation and usage schemata that are specific, well-defined and easy to understand. This paper introduces our vision for a holistic architecture for semantic annotation, indexing, and retrieval of documents with regard to extensive semantic repositories. A system (called KIM), implementing this concept, is presented in brief and it is used for the purposes of evaluation and demonstration. A particular schema for semantic annotation with respect to real-world entities is proposed. The underlying philosophy is that a practical semantic annotation is impossible without some particular knowledge modelling commitments. Our understanding is that a system for such semantic annotation should be based upon a simple model of real-world entity classes, complemented with extensive instance knowledge. To ensure the efficiency, ease of sharing, and reusability of the metadata, we introduce an upper-level ontology (of about 250 classes and 100 properties), which starts with some basic philosophical distinctions and then goes down to the most common entity types (people, companies, cities, etc.). Thus it encodes many of the domain-independent commonsense concepts and allows straightforward domain-specific extensions. On the basis of the ontology, a large-scale knowledge base of entity descriptions is bootstrapped, and further extended and maintained. Currently, the knowledge bases usually scales between 10^5 and 10^6 descriptions. Finally, this paper presents a semantically enhanced information extraction system, which provides automatic semantic annotation with references to classes in the ontology and to instances. The system has been running over a continuously growing document collection (currently about 0.5 million news articles), so it has been under constant testing and evaluation for some time now. On the basis of these semantic annotations, we perform semantic based indexing and retrieval where users can mix traditional information retrieval (IR) queries and ontology-based ones. We argue that such large-scale, fully automatic methods are essential for the transformation of the current largely textual web into a Semantic Web.},

@book{bertsekas2008introduction,
  abstract = {An intuitive, yet precise introduction to probability theory, stochastic processes, and probabilistic models used in science, engineering, economics, and related fields. The 2nd edition is a substantial revision of the 1st edition, involving a reorganization of old material and the addition of new material. The length of the book has increased by about 25 percent. The main new feature of the 2nd edition is thorough introduction to Bayesian and classical statistics.

The book is the currently used textbook for "Probabilistic Systems Analysis," an introductory probability course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attended by a large number of undergraduate and graduate students. The book covers the fundamentals of probability theory (probabilistic models, discrete and continuous random variables, multiple random variables, and limit theorems), which are typically part of a first course on the subject, as well as the fundamental concepts and methods of statistical inference, both Bayesian and classical. It also contains, a number of more advanced topics, from which an instructor can choose to match the goals of a particular course. These topics include transforms, sums of random variables, a fairly detailed introduction to Bernoulli, Poisson, and Markov processes.

The book strikes a balance between simplicity in exposition and sophistication in analytical reasoning. Some of the more mathematically rigorous analysis has been just intuitively explained in the text, but is developed in detail (at the level of advanced calculus) in the numerous solved theoretical problems. },

@article{juola2008authorship,
  abstract = {Authorship attribution, the science of inferring characteristics of the author from the characteristics of documents written by that author, is a problem with a long history and a wide range of application. Recent work in "non-traditional" authorship attribution demonstrates the practicality of automatically analyzing documents based on authorial style, but the state of the art is confusing. Analyses are difficult to apply, little is known about type or rate of errors, and few "best practices" are available. In part because of this confusion, the field has perhaps had less uptake and general acceptance than is its due.

This review surveys the history and present state of the discipline, presenting some comparative results when available. It shows, first, that the discipline is quite successful, even in difficult cases involving small documents in unfamiliar and less studied languages; it further analyzes the types of analysis and features used and tries to determine characteristics of well-performing systems, finally formulating these in a set of recommendations for best practices.},

@article{sutton2012introduction,
  abstract = {Many tasks involve predicting a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling. They combine the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This survey describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in many areas, including natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large-scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this survey is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields.

In modern applications of machine learning, predicting a single class label is often not enough. Instead we want to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other, such as a class label for every word in a document or for every region in an image. This structured prediction problem is significantly harder than the simple classification problem because we want to learn how the different labels depend on each other. Conditional random fields provide a powerful solution to this problem. They combine the advantages of classification and graphical modeling as they join the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. In the past ten years, there has been an explosion of interest in CRFs with applications as diverse as natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. An Introduction to Conditional Random Fields provides a comprehensive tutorial aimed at application-oriented practitioners seeking to apply CRFs. This survey does not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, and so is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields. It includes discussion of feature construction, inference, and parameter estimation in CRFs. Additionally, the monograph also includes sections on practical "tips of the trade" for CRFs that are difficult to find in the published literature.},

Participants included five outstanding elementary school teachers and four researchers from southern Taiwan. The framework developed by Trochim (1989) was used as the basis for the construction of concept mappings of the scientific imagination through five panel discussions among the experts. A review of the literature, qualitative interviews, classroom observation, and document analyses were performed on group concept mapping, and independent relevant documents were used for data validation. A qualitative method was employed for data analysis. Finally, we developed the personality, developmental process, picture-in-mind, and surroundings (3PS) model of scientific imagination. Research results indicated that the scientific imagination model not only enhanced understanding of scientific imagination but also applied to daily experiences. The results of the present study are relevant to future projects and research in this domain, including the development of academic-based checklists to foster scientific imagination, the establishment of appropriate assessment tools, and the formulation of a specific curriculum for teaching the concept of scientific imagination.},

@article{chen2006citespace,
  abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature‚Äîan evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981‚Äì2004) and terrorism (1990‚Äì2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.},

This problem has deep philosophical implications: If languages are all the same, it implies a fundamental commonality--and thus mutual intelligibility--of human thought.We are now on the verge of solving this problem. Using a twenty-year-old theory proposed by the world's greatest living linguist, Noam Chomsky, researchers have found that the similarities among languages are more profound than the differences. Languages whose grammars seem completely incompatible may in fact be structurally almost identical, except for a difference in one simple rule. The discovery of these rules and how they may vary promises to yield a linguistic equivalent of the Periodic Table of the Elements: a single framework by which we can understand the fundamental structure of all human language. This is a landmark breakthrough both within linguistics, which will herewith finally become a full-fledged science, and in our understanding of the human mind.},

  abstract = {In the past several years, Arabic Information Retrieval (IR) has garnered significant attention. The main research interests have focused on retrieval of formal language, mostly in the news domain, with ad hoc retrieval, OCR document retrieval, and cross-language retrieval. The literature on other aspects of retrieval continues to be sparse or non-existent, though some of these aspects have been investigated by industry. Others aspects of Arabic retrieval that have received attention include document image retrieval, speech search, social media and web search, and filtering. However, efforts on different aspects of Arabic retrieval continue to be deficient and severely lacking behind efforts in other languages. The survey covers: 1) general properties of the Arabic language; 2) some of the aspects of Arabic that affect retrieval; 3) Arabic processing necessary for effective Arabic retrieval; 4) Arabic retrieval in public IR evaluations; 5) specialized retrieval problems, namely Arabic-English CLIR, Arabic Document Image Retrieval, Arabic Social Search, Arabic Web Search, Question Answering, Image retrieval, and Arabic Speech Search; 6) Arabic IR and NLP resources; and 7) open IR problems that require further attention.

Arabic is ranked as the seventh largest language on the Internet but it has also been the fastest growing language in the last decade in terms of users. At this rate of growth, Arabic users should have the fourth largest user population on the Internet by 2020. Given these facts, it is not surprising that Arabic Information Retrieval (IR) has garnered significant attention. The main research interests have focused on retrieval of formal language, mostly in the news domain, with ad hoc retrieval, OCR document retrieval, and cross-language retrieval. The literature on other aspects of retrieval continues to be sparse or non-existent, though some of these aspects have been investigated by industry. Others aspects of Arabic retrieval that have received attention include document image retrieval, speech search, filtering, and social media and web search. However, efforts within different aspects of Arabic retrieval continue to be deficient and severely lacking behind efforts in other languages.

Arabic Information Retrieval reviews Arabic IR including the nature of the Arabic language, the techniques used for pre-processing the language, the latest research in Arabic IR in different domains, and the open areas in Arabic IR. It covers general properties of the Arabic language, aspects of Arabic that affect retrieval, Arabic processing necessary for effective Arabic retrieval, Arabic retrieval in public IR evaluations, Arabic IR and NLP resources, and specialized retrieval problems such as Arabic-English CLIR, Arabic Document Image Retrieval, Arabic Social Search, Arabic Web Search, Question Answering, Image retrieval, and Arabic Speech Search. Lastly, it also discusses open IR problems that require further attention.},

  abstract = {A multiple-perspective co-citation analysis method is introduced for characterizing and interpreting the structure and dynamics of co-citation clusters. The method facilitates analytic and sense making tasks by integrating network visualization, spectral clustering, automatic cluster labeling, and text summarization. Co-citation networks are decomposed into co-citation clusters. The interpretation of these clusters is augmented by automatic cluster labeling and summarization. The method focuses on the interrelations between a co-citation cluster's members and their citers. The generic method is applied to a three-part analysis of the field of Information Science as defined by 12 journals published between 1996 and 2008: 1) a comparative author co-citation analysis (ACA), 2) a progressive ACA of a time series of co-citation networks, and 3) a progressive document co-citation analysis (DCA). Results show that the multiple-perspective method increases the interpretability and accountability of both ACA and DCA networks.},

Scalable Game Design is a research project exploring new strategies of how to scale up from after school and summer programs into required curriculum of public schools through game design approaches. The project includes inner city schools, remote rural areas and Native American communities. A requirement checklist of computational thinking tools regarding curriculum, teacher training, standards and authoring tools has been developed and is being tested with thousands of students.},

@techreport{shell2015understanding,
  abstract = {Students' motivation and strategic engagement have been identified as playing crucial roles in their success in STEM and CS classes. Numerous motivational constructs have been identified including goals, instrumentality of the course, mindsets, emotional/affective reactions, and self-efficacy. These are thought to motivate students to achieve and to drive the self-regulation and engagement necessary for student-centered learning. Despite sometimes lengthy histories of research in these constructs and behaviors, there are still many questions about how students are motivated in their courses and how they can become effective self-directed, engaged learners. This talk will discuss research findings from five years of classroom research in introductory computer science courses. We have employed comprehensive pre- and post-survey questionnaires assessing student motivation, affect, and strategic engagement and examined impacts on grades and learning and the dynamics of motivation change across the semester. Courses have included computer science majors as well as engineering and other STEM and non-STEM undergraduates. We will talk about our findings and discuss implications for CS and STEM teaching and instruction in the undergraduate classroom.},

@article{vansoom2014profiling,
  abstract = {The low success rate of first-year college students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs has spurred many academic achievement studies in which explanatory factors are studied. In this study, we investigated from a person-oriented perspective whether different motivational and academic self-concept profiles could be discerned between male and female first-year college students in STEM and whether differences in early academic achievement were associated with these student groups. Data on autonomous motivation, academic self-concept, and early academic achievement of 1,400 first-year STEM college students were collected. Cluster analyses were used to distinguish motivational profiles based on the relative levels of autonomous motivation and academic self-concept for male and female students. Differences in early academic achievement of the various profiles were studied by means of ANCOVA. Four different motivational profiles were discerned based on the dimensions of autonomous motivation (A) and academic self-concept (S): students scoring high and respectively low on both dimensions (HA-HS or LA-LS), and students scoring high on one dimension and low on the other (HA-LS or LA-HS). Also gender differences were found in this study: male students with high levels of academic self-concept and autonomous motivation had higher academic achievement compared to male students with low levels on both motivational dimensions. For female students, motivational profiles were not associated with academic achievement. The findings partially confirm the internal and external validity of the motivational theories underpinning this study and extend the present insights on identifying subgroup(s) of at risk students in contemporary STEM programs at university level.},

Proponents offer a host of arguments in favor of such schooling. This chapter identifies and evaluates five broad rationales for SS schooling. We conclude that empirical evidence fails to support proponents' claims but nonetheless suggests ways in which to improve coeducation. Specifically, we (a) show that the purported benefits of SS schooling arise from factors confounded with, but not causally linked to, single-sex composition; (b) challenge claims that biological sex is an effective marker of differences relevant to instruction; (c) argue that sexism on the part of teachers and peers persists in SS contexts; and (d) critique the notion that gender per se "disappears" in SS contexts. We also address societal implications of the use of sex-segregated education and conclude that factors found to be beneficial for students should be implemented within coeducational schools.},

  abstract = {Faced with the exponential development of Big Data and both its legal and economic repercussions, we are still slightly in the dark concerning the use of digital information.  In the perpetual balance between confidentiality and transparency, this data will lead us to call into question how we understand certain paradigms, such as the Hippocratic Oath in medicine. As a consequence, a reflection on the study of the risks associated with the ethical issues surrounding the design and manipulation of this ‚Äúmassive data‚Äù seems to be essential. This book provides a direction and ethical value to these significant volumes of data. It proposes an ethical analysis model and recommendations to better keep this data in check. This empirical and ethico-technical approach brings together the first aspects of a moral framework directed toward thought, conscience and the responsibility of citizens concerned by the use of data of a personal nature.

Attack techniques proposed in the literature often require detailed knowledge of system parameters. Such information is difficult to acquire in practice. The subspace methods presented in this paper, on the other hand, learn the system operating subspace from measurements and launch attacks accordingly. Conditions for the existence of an unobservable subspace attack are obtained under the full and partial measurement models. Using the estimated system subspace, two attack strategies are presented. The first strategy aims to affect the system state directly by hiding the attack vector in the system subspace. The second strategy misleads the bad data detection mechanism so that data not under attack are removed. Performance of these attacks are evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus network and the IEEE 118-bus network.},

  abstract = {Introduction to Educational Research guides readers through the various steps of the research methods process to help plan and compose their first educational research project. Through comprehensive chapter content and in-text exercises, readers learn how to prepare a research plan, gather and analyze data, address research questions and hypotheses, and organize reports of their projects. The book is practical and student-friendly; Dr. Craig A. Mertler uses a conversational writing style with non-technical language to help students clearly understand and apply research concepts with no prior familiarity with the principles, procedures, or terminology.

This chapter deals with mixed-methods research, a group of approaches to conducting educational research studies that combines both quantitative and qualitative data. While that description may seem somewhat basic and straightforward, there are many important aspects to consider. In this chapter, we will look at the characteristics of mixed-methods research, along with various designs and other important decisions to be made during the process of conducting mixed-methods research studies.

Characteristics of Mixed-Methods Research

The major characteristic of mixed-methods research is that it combines quantitative and qualitative approaches by including both quantitative and qualitative data in a single research study (Gay, Mills, & Airasian, 2009). Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) define mixed-methods research as those studies that include at least one quantitative strand and one qualitative strand. A strand is a component of a study that encompasses the basic process of conducting quantitative or qualitative research: posing a research question, collecting and analyzing data, and interpreting the results. However, these are merely ‚Äúsurface-level‚Äù descriptions of the characteristics of mixed-methods research. We will look more closely at specific characteristics in a moment.

Before examining various characteristics of this approach to conducting research, it is important to understand when and how mixed-methods research began. Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) date the beginnings of mixed-methods research back to the mid- to late 1980s. Methodology experts and writers from all around the world seemed to have been simultaneously working on similar ideas regarding the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Up to this point in time, many qualitative researchers and quantitative researchers did not see the legitimacy in the other approach to doing research. However, members of both research camps began to realize, on a deeper level, the value of the alternate approach. For example, quantitative researchers began to see that qualitative data could play an important role in quantitative research; similarly, qualitative researchers began to see that reporting only qualitative views of the world ‚Äì and of a few individuals ‚Äì would not permit generalization of the findings to many other individuals and audiences (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). Over the past decade or more, interest in the use of mixed-methods research as a means for studying educational topics and phenomenon has grown substantially.

Between the late 1980s and today, definitions and descriptions of mixed-methods research have shifted and morphed, and they continue to do so. While having a singular definition is desirable for many researchers, Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) have instead offered a definition of core characteristics of mixed-methods research. They suggest that their core characteristics provide a broader definition of mixed-methods research, since they combine methods, philosophies, and a research design orientation. These characteristics also highlight the key components that should be considered when designing and conducting a mixed-methods study. These six core characteristics focus on activities of the mixed-methods researcher and include the following actions:

-       Collecting and analyzing persuasively and rigorously both qualitative and quantitative data, based on research questions [emphasis added]

-       Mixing ‚Äì or integrating or linking ‚Äì the two forms of data either concurrently by combining or merging them, sequentially by having one build on the other, or embedding one within the other

-       Giving priority to one or to both forms of data, again based on the research questions and the emphasis of the research [emphasis added]

-       Using these procedures in a single research study or in multiple phases of a program of research

-       Framing these procedures within philosophical worldviews and theoretical lenses

-       Combining the procedures into specific research designs that direct the plan for conducting the study (p. 5)

These core characteristics provide an extremely comprehensive perspective on the critical aspects of engaging in mixed-methods research. You will see them integrated into our discussions as we proceed through this chapter.

Not unlike any other approach to conducting research, when preparing a research study that will use a mixed methodology, the researcher must provide a justification for the use of this approach. Researchers would need to do this even if they were engaged in a study that was purely qualitative or purely quantitative. There are specific situations that would more likely warrant a research approach that capitalizes on the combination of quantitative and qualitative data. Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) have described six scenarios or examples of research problems that are best suited for mixed-methods research:

-       A need exists because one data source may be insufficient. As you know, qualitative data provide understanding through greater depth, whereas quantitative data provide broader, more general understanding. Each approach has its advantages and limitations. Qualitative data may provide a deep examination of a phenomenon of interest but only with respect to a handful of participants. On the other hand, quantitative data can provide information across a much broader sampling of participants, but the depth of that information is certainly limited. Depending on the goals of a research study ‚Äì as well as its guiding research questions ‚Äì one type of data alone may not tell the complete picture or adequately answer the research questions. Additionally, the results from the analysis of qualitative data and those from the collection of quantitative data may be contradictory, which could not have been discovered if only one type or the other was collected and analyzed. Using both types of data in a single research study provides depth as well as breadth.

-       A need exists to explain initial results. Sometimes researchers find themselves in situations where the results of the study do not provide complete understanding of the research problem; further explanation is needed. This additional explanation can be provided through the collection and analysis of a second set of data that helps explain the results of the initial set of data. For example, quantitative data can be used to provide numerical expressions of the relationships among variables or differences between groups, but detailed understanding of what those relationships mean or from where the differences came (i.e., the meanings behind the results of the statistical tests) can be provided only by qualitative data collection and analysis, as a follow-up to the initial collection of quantitative data.

-       A need exists to generalize exploratory findings. As you know from your studies of qualitative research methods, in some research investigations entered into by researchers, the research questions are not known, the variables cannot yet be identified, and the goals of the research cannot be specified at the outset of the study. In these scenarios, an initial phase focused on the collection of qualitative data is necessary simply to explore the setting or participants involved. Once there is enhanced general knowledge of the research situation, the qualitative phase can be followed up with a quantitative study to generalize and test what was learned from the initial exploration.

-       A need exists to enhance a study with a second method. In some research situations, a second method can be added to provide enhanced understanding of some phase of research that has been conducted. For example, a researcher could add a qualitative component to enhance an experimental, correlational, or causal-comparative study. Similarly, quantitative data could be added to enhance the findings of an ethnographic, narrative, or grounded theory research study. In these situations, however, the second method is embedded or nested within the primary method. The design of this approach should not be confused with the one described above, where the second method is used as a follow-up to the initial method of data collection.

-       A need exists to best employ a theoretical stance. There may be a particular research situation where a theoretical perspective dictates the need to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. All data could either be collected simultaneously or sequentially, with one form of data building on the other. The application of a particular theoretical viewpoint may determine this specific need.

-       A need exists to understand a research objective through multiple research phases. Many research studies require multiple research phases ‚Äì which may or may not be viewed as individual, separate studies ‚Äì whereby researchers may need to connect several seemingly independent studies to achieve the overall research goal. This is a common approach used in comprehensive and/or multiyear evaluation or other types of longitudinal studies. As with the previous need, data may be collected simultaneously or sequentially. If the phases of data collection are simultaneous, or occur relatively close in time, we refer to the study as a multiphase mixed-methods research study; if the phases of data collection are distinctly separated by substantial periods of time, we might refer to the study as a multiproject mixed-methods study.

These scenarios illustrate situations in which mixed-methods research would be an appropriate design for investigating the particular problems. Although this list is not necessarily exhaustive, these cases and explanations can certainly serve as justifications for the researchers‚Äô need to use a particular mixed-methods research design. In many cases, researchers may combine some of these six explanations to provide the most accurate justification for the use of mixed-methods designs. As you will also see later in the chapter, these six research problems lay the groundwork for and parallel the various designs of mixed-methods research we will examine shortly.

The Mixed-Methods Research Process

As you might expect, the process for conducting mixed-methods research closely parallels the general process for conducting educational research, presented in Chapter 2. That being said, there are some unique aspects to consider in the process of conducting mixed-methods research. The entire process is outlined and described below (Creswell, 2005; Fraenkel, Wallen, & Hyun, 2012); however, if you compare these steps with those described in Chapter 2, you will notice the additional, unique aspects in the process of conducting mixed-methods research:

1.     Identification of the research problem to be studied. As we have seen numerous times in this book, the clear identification and specification of a research topic is the first step in any study. Consider that you may want to include both quantitative and qualitative data; however, do not become overly concerned about balancing the two forms of data at this point in the process.

2.     Determination of whether a mixed-methods study is feasible.  If you believe that your study will benefit from the use of quantitative and qualitative data, you must consider what this entails. First and foremost, you must have well-developed skills in gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. Gathering both types of data will also be more time-consuming; so you must factor in the desired timetable for your study. Additionally, you must have the appropriate skills to analyze both types of data. Finally, it is important to consider the make-up of potential audiences for your research ‚Äì those audiences should be able to understand and have an appreciation for the complexity of mixed-methods designs. If any of the above conditions are not adequately satisfied, a mixed-methods study is likely not feasible.

3.     Development of a clear and sound rationale for doing a mixed-methods study. Provided the study is feasible, you should consider and be prepared to answer questions of why you are collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, why both types of data are necessary, and how the study will be enhanced as a result of doing so. Again, if you cannot be clear and explicit in providing a rationale, a mixed-methods study may not be appropriate.

4.     Identification of the appropriate mixed-methods design to guide your data collection. We will discuss mixed-methods designs shortly, but for now you will need to determine the following aspects of your data collection strategy:

-       The priority you will give to quantitative and qualitative data

-       The sequence of your data collection, if you do not plan to collect both types of data simultaneously

-       The specific forms of quantitative and qualitative data you will collect

The determinations you make regarding these three items will typically align with a particular mixed-methods research design, which you should identify for inclusion in your final research report.

5.     Development of research questions for both quantitative and qualitative methods. In a mixed-methods study, researchers typically delineate research questions that pertain specifically to the analysis of quantitative data and ones that pertain specifically to the analysis of qualitative data. It is possible also to add research questions that can be answered by the combination of the interpretations of both kinds of analysis. Depending on the nature of your study, some of the research questions may need to emerge during the course of the study. For example, if you are collecting quantitative data to be followed with collection of qualitative data, those qualitative research questions will likely depend on the outcomes of the quantitative data analysis. (It is important to note that Steps 4 and 5 may occur in reverse order or concurrently.)

6.     Review of related literature and development of a written review. Reviewing related literature provides the same benefits we have discussed in previous chapters ‚Äì guiding aspects of your study and contextualizing your study. You should develop a thorough written review of the pertinent body of literature to be included in your final research report.

7.     Collection of data. Qualitative and quantitative procedures for the collection of data, which will be described in full in Chapters 11 and 12, are appropriate for mixed-methods research as well. In fact, there are no differences in data collection procedures ‚Äì quantitative data in a mixed-methods study are collected just as quantitative data in any study would be, and the same holds true for qualitative data. The only caveat, however, is that care must be taken to ensure that data are collected so they parallel the mixed-methods research design you specified earlier.

8.     Analysis of data. Similarly, data analysis proceeds just as presented in Chapters 11 and 13. The exception is that you must determine ‚Äì based on the mixed-methods design you are using ‚Äì whether you will analyze quantitative data separately from quantitative data or integrate the two types of data analysis. Again, you must ensure that you are following the particular process outlined by the specific mixed-methods research design you chose.

9.     Development of conclusions and recommendations. You must draw conclusions, inferences, and recommendations directly from the interpretation of results of the data analysis. Once again, however, you must ensure that you are interpreting the data appropriately; in other words, you must determine if the interpretations of your analytical results will be drawn separately and sequentially, or if they will be done in an integrated, concurrent manner.

10.  Preparation of a final research report.  The final step in conducting a mixed-methods research study is to prepare the final research report. There is some variation in developing a report of mixed-methods research, compared with a report of just quantitative or just qualitative research. Specifically, the report should parallel your data analysis and interpretation of results. For example, if your study involved separate data collection, analysis, and interpretation for your quantitative data and qualitative data, your report should contain two separate sections for the collection, analysis, and interpretation ‚Äì one for each type of data. In contrast, if your analysis and interpretation were integrated into one process across both types of data, you should include only one section reporting the combination of quantitative and qualitative data. Thus, the data analysis section is an attempt to converge both types of data into a single set of results and interpretations, relating directly back to the research problem and guiding questions.

The volume concerns lexical inequality, the fact that some words and phrases share the quality of being key ‚Äì and thereby reflect or promote important themes ‚Äì in some textual contexts, while others do not. The patterning of words which differ in their centrality to text meaning is of increasing interest to corpus linguistics. At the same time software resources are yielding increasingly more detailed ways of identifying and studying the linkages between key words and phrases in text databases. This volume brings together work from some of the leading researchers in this field. It presents thirteen studies organized in three sections, the first containing a series of studies exploring the nature of keyness itself, then a set of five studies looking at keyness in specific discourse contexts, and then three studies with an educational focus.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of effort to create fair classrooms and schools, gender bias is alive and well, and in some ways growing. School practices continue to send boys and girls down different life paths, too often treating them not as different genders but as different species. Teachers and parents often miss the subtle signs of sexism in classrooms. Through firsthand observations and up-to-the-minute research, Still Failing at Fairness brings the gender issue into focus.

The authors provide an in-depth account of how girls' and boys' educations are compromised from elementary school through college, and offer practical advice for teachers and parents who want to make a positive difference. The authors examine today's pressing issues -- the lack of enforcement for Title IX, the impact of the backlash against gender equity, the much-hyped "boys' crisis," hardwired brain differences, and the recent growth of singlesex public schools. This book documents how teaching, current testing practices, and subtle cultural attitudes continue to short-circuit both girls and boys of every race, social class, and ethnicity. Hard-hitting and remarkably informative, Still Failing at Fairness is "a fascinating look into America's classrooms.},

With an increased focus on connecting theory to application, the second edition incorporates diverse perspectives on why and how individuals are motivated to work toward competence in school, work, sports, and other settings. Leading authorities present cutting-edge findings on the psychological, sociocultural, and biological processes that shape competence motivation across development, analyzing the role of intelligence, self-regulated learning, emotions, creativity, gender and racial stereotypes, self-perceptions, achievement values, parenting practices, teacher behaviors, workplace environments, and many other factors. As a special bonus, purchasers of the second edition can download a supplemental e-book featuring several notable, highly cited chapters from the first edition.

New to This Edition
*Most chapters are new, reflecting over a decade of theoretical and methodological developments.
*Each chapter now has an applied as well as conceptual focus, showcasing advances in intervention research.
*Additional topics: self-regulation in early childhood, self-determination theory, challenge and threat appraisals, performance incentives, achievement emotions, job burnout, gene-environment interactions, class-based models of competence, and the impact of social group membership.
*Supplemental e-book featuring selected chapters from the prior edition.

You are holding in your hands a complete encyclopedia of current thinking on motivation and, more generally, the psychology of achievement. I cannot imagine a more esteemed group of authors to guide readers through the fundamentals of this area--and right up to the cutting edge.

Like the first edition of this handbook, the second edition brings together the world's greatest experts on competence motivation to provide readers with the most important ideas and recent discoveries. And it does something else that is new to this edition and very significant: it discusses exciting applications in key domains of everyday life, including education, business, and athletics. More than ever, this is a 'must-read' handbook for researchers, practitioners, and students.

This handbook is the best evidence to date that the field of motivation is alive and well, and that it provides a valuable framework for addressing complex, real-world challenges, such as the racial achievement gap and the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields. Kudos to the editors and chapter authors for assuring the continued vitality of our field.},

The scientific problems within present linguistics, the book contends, combine with social problems of the society in which linguists participate to press linguistics to discover ethnographic foundations. The work of providing such foundations largely remains to be done. Working out the implications of these three principles requires a new mode of description of linguistic features and relationships, a mode which can treat the verbal means of a community as a part of its organization of communicative means.

    In Part One, Dell Hymes indicates the place of linguistic inquiry as part of an inquiry into communicable conduct in general. Part Two demonstrates the mutual relation between linguistics and other disciplines that contribute to the common larger field‚Äîsociology, social anthropology, education, folklore, and poetics are discussed. In Part Three the author argues that problems within linguistic inquiry suggest social foundations of linguistics deeper than presently assumed, such that social meaning and stylistic function must be taken into account systematically, and social life seen as a source of the organization of linguistic means.},

@book{christiansen2016creating,
  abstract = {Language is a hallmark of the human species; the flexibility and unbounded expressivity of our linguistic abilities is unique in the biological world. In this book, Morten Christiansen and Nick Chater argue that to understand this astonishing phenomenon, we must consider how language is created: moment by moment, in the generation and understanding of individual utterances; year by year, as new language learners acquire language skills; and generation by generation, as languages change, split, and fuse through the processes of cultural evolution. Christiansen and Chater propose a revolutionary new framework for understanding the evolution, acquisition, and processing of language, offering an integrated theory of how language creation is intertwined across these multiple timescales.

    Christiansen and Chater argue that mainstream generative approaches to language do not provide compelling accounts of language evolution, acquisition, and processing. Their own account draws on important developments from across the language sciences, including statistical natural language processing, learnability theory, computational modeling, and psycholinguistic experiments with children and adults. Christiansen and Chater also consider some of the major implications of their theoretical approach for our understanding of how language works, offering alternative accounts of specific aspects of language, including the structure of the vocabulary, the importance of experience in language processing, and the nature of recursive linguistic structure.

    Our understanding of language -- its evolution, acquisition, and processing -- is undergoing a seismic shift and this engaging, ambitious book clarifies and motivates the new exciting landscape.

    This book is unique in its attempt to take a usage-based and unified approach to the sciences of language: its evolution, historical change, processing, and acquisition. It covers an extraordinarily wide range of relevant and up-to-date literature from which it builds an important theoretical approach. It provides the foundation for asking all the fundamental questions in language research.

    Christiansen and Chater's Creating Language presents a compelling account of how acquisition and processing mutually constrain one another in shaping both linguistic performance and the nature of language. Then, to top it off, they fearlessly touch the linguistic third rail, language evolution, and the time scales shift from milliseconds and months, to millennia. The book will excite controversy, but it most certainly will excite.},

  abstract = {"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are "engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components." CPS can be small and closed, such as an artificial pancreas, or very large, complex, and interconnected, such as a regional energy grid. CPS engineering focuses on managing inter- dependencies and impact of physical aspects on cyber aspects, and vice versa. With the development of low-cost sensing, powerful embedded system hardware, and widely deployed communication networks, the reliance on CPS for system functionality has dramatically increased. These technical developments in combination with the creation of a workforce skilled in engineering CPS will allow the deployment of increasingly capable, adaptable, and trustworthy systems. Engineers responsible for developing CPS but lacking the appropriate education or training may not fully understand at an appropriate depth, on the one hand, the technical issues associated with the CPS software and hardware or, on the other hand, techniques for physical system modeling, energy and power, actuation, signal processing, and control. In addition, these engineers may be designing and implementing life-critical systems without appropriate formal training in CPS methods needed for verification and to assure safety, reliability, and security. A workforce with the appropriate education, training, and skills will be better positioned to create and manage the next generation of CPS solutions. A 21st Century Cyber-Physical Systems Education examines the intellectual content of the emerging field of CPS and its implications for engineering and computer science education. This report is intended to inform those who might support efforts to develop curricula and materials; faculty and university administrators; industries with needs for CPS workers; and current and potential students about intellectual foundations, workforce requirements, employment opportunities, and curricular needs"--Publisher's description.},

@book{lee2017introduction,
  abstract = {The most visible use of computers and software is processing information for human consumption. The vast majority of computers in use, however, are much less visible. They run the engine, brakes, seatbelts, airbag, and audio system in your car. They digitally encode your voice and construct a radio signal to send it from your cell phone to a base station. They command robots on a factory floor, power generation in a power plant, processes in a chemical plant, and traffic lights in a city. These less visible computers are called embedded systems, and the software they run is called embedded software. The principal challenges in designing and analyzing embedded systems stem from their interaction with physical processes. This book takes a cyber-physical approach to embedded systems, introducing the engineering concepts underlying embedded systems as a technology and as a subject of study. The focus is on modeling, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which integrate computation, networking, and physical processes.

The second edition offers two new chapters, several new exercises, and other improvements. The book can be used as a textbook at the advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level and as a professional reference for practicing engineers and computer scientists. Readers should have some familiarity with machine structures, computer programming, basic discrete mathematics and algorithms, and signals and systems.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades the use of increasingly large text corpora has grown rapidly in language and linguistics research. This was enabled by remarkable strides in natural language processing (NLP) technology, technology that enables computers to automatically and efficiently process, annotate and analyze large amounts of spoken and written text in linguistically and/or pragmatically meaningful ways. It has become more desirable than ever before for language and linguistics researchers who use corpora in their research to gain an adequate understanding of the relevant NLP technology to take full advantage of its capabilities.

	This volume provides language and linguistics researchers with an accessible introduction to the state-of-the-art NLP technology that facilitates automatic annotation and analysis of large text corpora at both shallow and deep linguistic levels. The book covers a wide range of computational tools for lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and discourse analysis, together with detailed instructions on how to obtain, install and use each tool in different operating systems and platforms. The book illustrates how NLP technology has been applied in recent corpus-based language studies and suggests effective ways to better integrate such technology in future corpus linguistics research.

	This book provides language and linguistics researchers with a valuable reference for corpus annotation and analysis.

	Computational Methods for Corpus Annotation and Analysis‚Äô is an excellent book for corpus linguists who are interested in using advanced corpus queries. It presents the latest computational tools for corpus annotation and analysis in a very accessible manner. The advice and resources in the book are also very practical and useful. It is highly recommended to researchers and students of corpus linguistics.},

@book{poesio2016anaphora,
  abstract = {This book lays out a path leading from the linguistic and cognitive basics, to classical rule-based and machine learning algorithms, to today‚Äôs state-of-the-art approaches, which use advanced empirically grounded techniques, automatic knowledge acquisition, and refined linguistic modeling to make a real difference in real-world applications. Anaphora and coreference resolution both refer to the process of linking textual phrases (and, consequently, the information attached to them) within as well as across sentence boundaries, and to the same discourse referent.

The book offers an overview of recent research advances, focusing on practical, operational approaches and their applications. In part I (Background), it provides a general introduction, which succinctly summarizes the linguistic, cognitive, and computational foundations of anaphora processing and the key classical rule- and machine-learning-based anaphora resolution algorithms. Acknowledging the central importance of shared resources, part II (Resources) covers annotated corpora, formal evaluation, preprocessing technology, and off-the-shelf anaphora resolution systems. Part III (Algorithms) provides a thorough description of state-of-the-art anaphora resolution algorithms, covering enhanced machine learning methods as well as techniques for accomplishing important subtasks such as mention detection and acquisition of relevant knowledge. Part IV (Applications) deals with a selection of important anaphora and coreference resolution applications, discussing particular scenarios in diverse domains and distilling a best-practice model for systematically approaching new application cases. In the concluding part V (Outlook), based on a survey conducted among the contributing authors, the prospects of the research field of anaphora processing are discussed, and promising new areas of interdisciplinary cooperation and emerging application scenarios are identified.

    Given the book‚Äôs design, it can be used both as an accompanying text for advanced lectures in computational linguistics, natural language engineering, and computer science, and as a reference work for research and independent study. It addresses an audience that includes academic researchers, university lecturers, postgraduate students, advanced undergraduate students, industrial researchers, and software engineers.},

Further, students who do study computational topics tend to not reflect the greater student body, with female and minority students being disproportionately underrepresented. To address these issues, we investigate the approach of embedding computational thinking content into required high school mathematics and science coursework. Using data from a 3-year implementation, we present results showing differences in attitudes towards computing by gender, while also finding similar gaps do not correlate with aptitude. Using pre/post mea sures, we then show female participants expressed improved confidence with computational thinking and interest in STEM careers. Additionally, we report a dosage effect, where participating in more activities resulted in greater learning gains, providing evidence in support of embedding computational thinking enhanced activities across high school curriculum.},

Whereas previous books have in general given frequency information about the written language only, this book provides information on both speech and writing. It not only gives information about the language as a whole, but also about the differences between spoken and written English, and between different spoken and written varieties of the language. The frequencies are derived from a wide ranging and up-to-date corpus of English: the British National Corpus, which was compiled from over 4,000 written texts and spoken transcriptions representing the present day language in the UK. The book is based on a new version of the corpus (available from 2001) providing more accurate grammatical information, which is essential (for example) for distinguishing words like leaves (noun) and leaves (verb) with different meanings. The book begins with a general introduction, explaining why such information is important and highlighting interesting linguistic findings that emerge from the statistical analysis of the British National Corpus vocabulary. It also contains twenty four 'interest boxes' which highlight and comment on different aspects of frequency - for example, the most common colour words in English in order of frequency, and a comparison of male words (e.g. man) and female words (e.g. woman) in terms of their frequency. },

Written for classroom teachers (K-12, ESL, EFL), this book teaches the most common ESL grammar points in an accessible way through real ESL errors together with suggested teaching techniques. Relevant grammar terminology is explained.

    The four objectives of this book are to help teachers: (1) identify common ESL grammar points and understand the details associated with each one; (2) improve their ability to answer any grammar question on the spot (when on the ‚Äúhot seat‚Äù); (3) anticipate common ESL errors by grammar point, by first language, and/or by proficiency level; and (4) develop more effective grammar/language learning lessons. These objectives are for all teachers, whether they are teaching grammar directly or indirectly  in a variety of classes ‚Äì including a grammar class, a writing class, a speaking class, an ESP class, or a K-12 class.

    In the Second Edition, all chapters have been updated and substantively revised. The number of marginal (gray) boxes with tips and extra information has doubled. A 16th Key, on Negating, and three new appendixes have been added. One of the new appendixes provides a sample exercise from an actual ESL textbook plus relevant notes about the designing of grammar activities and suggestions for teaching each grammar point.

    Also added to each Key is a section on the vocabulary items (e.g., collocations) that are related to the teaching of that particular grammar point. This information is unique to this edition and cannot be found elsewhere on the market. },

However, in order for them to be widely employed and accepted as a learning resource, they must be easy to use and friendly. In this paper we present an architecture that facilitates building interactive pedagogical chatbots that can interact with students in natural language. Our proposal provides a modular and scalable framework to develop such systems efficiently. Additionally, we present Geranium, a system that helps children to appreciate and protect their environment with an interactive chatbot developed following our scheme.},

@book{weisser2016practical,
  abstract = {This is the first book of its kind to provide a practical and student-friendly guide to corpus linguistics that explains the nature of electronic data and how it can be collected and analyzed.

    Designed to equip readers with the technical skills necessary to analyze and interpret language data, both written and (orthographically) transcribed.

    Introduces a number of easy-to-use, yet powerful, free analysis resources consisting of standalone programs and web interfaces for use with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

    Each section includes practical exercises, a list of sources and further reading, and illustrated step-by-step introductions to analysis tools.

    Requires only a basic knowledge of computer concepts in order to develop the specific linguistic analysis skills required for understanding/analyzing corpus data.

    This textbook makes Practical Corpus Linguistics accessible to everyone. The focus on methodological and technical aspects and the instructive dimension of the book - nothing is considered obvious or already known - make it very useful to any corpus linguist aiming at a better understanding of his/her data. Through the various exercises, it is very easy to test one's comprehension and the reader gradually gains confidence.

    The educational, sometimes entertaining tone as well as the glossary also contribute to gradually enhance the reader's learning capacities in a field in which many feel insecure. It should accompany scholars at the beginning of any research to raise awareness about technical issues that are too often overlooked.

    Designed to help readers analyze and interpret language data, both written and (orthographically) transcribed, Practical Corpus Linguistics offers a step-by-step guide to this burgeoning field of linguistics research.

    In this accessible introduction, Martin Weisser not only explains the nature of electronic data, illustrating how it can be collected and prepared for analysis purposes, but also demonstrates ways of comparing the results of readers' own smaller-scale analyses to facts obtained from general reference corpora.

    Each section includes practical exercises, a list of sources and further reading, and illustrated step-by-step introductions to analysis tools.

    Seamlessly balancing computer science with linguistic theory, Practical Corpus Linguistics is  essential reading for anyone interested in developing the specific linguistic analysis skills required for analyzing corpus data.},

  abstract = {This study examined the continued gender imbalance in mathematics participation in senior high, which has implications for adolescents' future careers. It confirms persisting greater male participation in maths-related educational and occupational choices among this sample of Australian youth. Gendered course-taking in maths, along with participation intentions for maths-related careers, were explained using the Expectancy-Value framework of Eccles and colleagues (Eccles (Parsons) et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). The influences of maths-related self-perceptions, intrinsic and utility values, and perceived task difficulty were assessed using longitudinal data from a sample of 442 adolescents spanning Grades 9 through 11 in Sydney, Australia. Gendered maths-related self-perceptions and intrinsic values were the major influences on gendered educational participation in senior high maths, which subsequently predicted maths-related career aspirations--over and above prior mathematical achievement. Utility value showed a curvilinear relationship with maths-related occupational intentions moderated by gender, whereby girls with the highest utility values planned for highly maths-related careers, while boys with mid through high utility values planned similarly highly maths-related careers. Recommendations focus on ways to enhance participation in maths, especially for girls.},

    This illuminating and highly readable collection of essays explores some of the myths, for example: standards of children's speech and writing have declined; women talk too much; the 'purity' of the English language is under threat; some languages are more attractive to the ear or are harder to learn than others; the media has a detrimental effect on language. These widely held views are questioned and shown to be based on inadequate or false information, or simply, not to be true. Other essays explore spelling problems, attitudes towards accents, controversies over changes in language, and the belief that some languages have no grammar.

    A unique collection of original essays by 21 of the world's leading linguists. The topics discussed focus on some of the most popular myths about language: The Media Are Ruining English; Children Can't Speak or Write Properly Anymore; America is Ruining the English Language. The tone is lively and entertaining throughout and there are cartoons from Doonesbury andThe Wizard of Id to illustrate some of the points. The book should have a wide readership not only amongst students who want to read leading linguists writing about popular misconceptions but also amongst the large number of people who enjoy reading about language in general.},

Three analytical approaches are introduced and compared, describing a wide range of texts from the perspectives of register, genre and style. The primary focus of the book is on the analysis of registers.

  	Part 1 introduces an analytical framework for studying registers, genre conventions, and styles.

  	Part 2 provides detailed descriptions of particular text varieties in English, including spoken interpersonal varieties (conversation, university office hours, service encounters), written varieties (newspapers, academic prose, fiction), and emerging electronic varieties (e-mail, internet forums, text messages).

  	Finally, Part 3 introduces advanced analytical approaches using corpora, and discusses theoretical concerns, such as the place of register studies in linguistics, and practical applications of register analysis. Each chapter ends with three types of activities: reflection and review activities, analysis activities, and larger project ideas.

	This outstanding and highly accessible guide should definitely be useful to students of linguistics and language teachers who may wish to incorporate textual analyses in their teaching. Particularly, the volume can be used as a textbook for courses on register, genre, and style in applied English programs worldwide. clearly, the information presented in this practice-oriented volume has been compiled through years of work and research and serves as an essential reading for those interested in the analysis of registers and other related textual studies.},

Drawing on the latest neuroscientific insights, Dr. Oakley shepherds us past simplistic ideas of "aptitude" and "ability," which provide only a snapshot of who we are now--with little consideration about how we can change. Even seemingly "bad" traits, such as a poor memory, come with hidden advantages--like increased creativity. Profiling people from around the world who have overcome learning limitations of all kinds, Dr. Oakley shows us how we can turn perceived weaknesses, such as impostor syndrome and advancing age, into strengths. People may feel like they're at a disadvantage if they pursue a new field later in life; yet those who change careers can be fertile cross-pollinators: They bring valuable insights from one discipline to another. Dr. Oakley teaches us strategies for learning that are backed by neuroscience so that we can realize the joy and benefits of a learning lifestyle. Mindshift takes us deep inside the world of how people change and grow. Our biggest stumbling blocks can be our own preconceptions, but with the right mental insights, we can tap into hidden potential and create new opportunities"--},

@article{weintrop2016defining,
  abstract = {Science and mathematics are becoming computational endeavors. This fact is reflected in the recently released Next Generation Science Standards and the decision to include "computational thinking" as a core scientific practice. With this addition, and the increased presence of computation in mathematics and scientific contexts, a new urgency has come to the challenge of defining computational thinking and providing a theoretical grounding for what form it should take in school science and mathematics classrooms. This paper presents a response to this challenge by proposing a definition of computational thinking for mathematics and science in the form of a taxonomy consisting of four main categories: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational problem solving practices, and systems thinking practices. In formulating this taxonomy, we draw on the existing computational thinking literature, interviews with mathematicians and scientists, and exemplary computational thinking instructional materials. This work was undertaken as part of a larger effort to infuse computational thinking into high school science and mathematics curricular materials. In this paper, we argue for the approach of embedding computational thinking in mathematics and science contexts, present the taxonomy, and discuss how we envision the taxonomy being used to bring current educational efforts in line with the increasingly computational nature of modern science and mathematics.},

  abstract = {Learning a language involves so much more than just rote memorization of rules. Basics of Language for Language Learners, 2nd edition, by Peter W. Culicover and Elizabeth V. Hume, systematically explores all the aspects of language central to second language learning: the sounds of language, the different grammatical structures, the social functions of communication, and the psychology of language learning and use.

    Unlike books specific to one single language, Basics of Language will help students of all languages. Readers will gain insight into the structure and use of their own language and will therefore see more clearly how the language they are learning differs from their first language. Language instructors will find the approach provocative, and the book will stimulate many new and effective ideas for teaching. Both a textbook and a reference work, Basics of Language will enhance the learning experience for anyone taking a foreign language course as well as the do-it-yourself learner.

    A new section, ``Tools and Strategies for Language Learning,'' has been added to this second edition. It comprises three chapters that focus on brain training, memory and using a dictionary. In addition, the section ``Thinking Like a Native Speaker'' has been substantially updated to include more discussion of errors made by language learners.},

@book{garner2016garners,
  abstract = {With more than a thousand new entries and more than 2,300 word-frequency ratios, the magisterial fourth edition of this book-now renamed Garner's Modern English Usage (GMEU)-reflects usage lexicography at its finest. Garner explains the nuances of grammar and vocabulary with thoroughness, finesse, and wit. He discourages whatever is slovenly, pretentious, or pedantic.

    GMEU is the liveliest and most compulsively readable reference work for writers of our time. It delights while providing instruction on skillful, persuasive, and vivid writing. Garner liberates English from two extremes: both from the hidebound "purists" who mistakenly believe that split infinitives and sentence-ending prepositions are malfeasances and from the linguistic relativists who believe that whatever people say or write must necessarily be accepted.

    The judgments here are backed up not just by a lifetime of study but also by an empirical grounding in the largest linguistic corpus ever available. In this fourth edition, Garner has made extensive use of corpus linguistics to include ratios of standard terms as compared against variants in modern print sources. No other resource provides as comprehensive, reliable, and empirical a guide to current English usage.

    For all concerned with writing and editing, GMEU will prove invaluable as a desk reference. Garner illustrates with actual examples, cited with chapter and verse, all the linguistic blunders that modern writers and speakers are prone to, whether in word choice, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, or pronunciation. No matter how knowledgeable you may already be, you're sure to learn from every single page of this book.},

@book{roelleke2013information,
  abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) models are a core component of IR research and IR systems. The past decade brought a consolidation of the family of IR models, which by 2000 consisted of relatively isolated views on TF-IDF (Term-Frequency times Inverse-Document-Frequency) as the weighting scheme in the vector-space model (VSM), the probabilistic relevance framework (PRF), the binary independence retrieval (BIR) model, BM25 (Best-Match Version 25, the main instantiation of the PRF/BIR), and language modelling (LM). Also, the early 2000s saw the arrival of divergence from randomness (DFR).

Regarding intuition and simplicity, though LM is clear from a probabilistic point of view, several people stated: "It is easy to understand TF-IDF and BM25. For LM, however, we understand the math, but we do not fully understand why it works."

This book takes a horizontal approach gathering the foundations of TF-IDF, PRF, BIR, Poisson, BM25, LM, probabilistic inference networks (PIN's), and divergence-based models. The aim is to create a consolidated and balanced view on the main models.

A particular focus of this book is on the "relationships between models." This includes an overview over the main frameworks (PRF, logical IR, VSM, generalized VSM) and a pairing of TF-IDF with other models. It becomes evident that TF-IDF and LM measure the same, namely the dependence (overlap) between document and query. The Poisson probability helps to establish probabilistic, non-heuristic roots for TF-IDF, and the Poisson parameter, average term frequency, is a binding link between several retrieval models and model parameters.},

@book{chomsky2015syntactic,
  abstract = {2015 Reprint of 1957 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. American linguist Paul Postal wrote in 1964 that most of the "syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States" were "versions of the theory of phrase structure grammars in the sense of Chomsky". British linguist John Lyons wrote in 1966 that "no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's Syntactic Structures." Prominent historian of linguistics R. H. Robins wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's "Syntactic Structures" was "probably the most radical and important change in direction in descriptive linguistics and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years". Another historian of linguistics Frederick Newmeyer considers "Syntactic Structures" "revolutionary" for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a formal yet non-empiricist theory of language was possible and more importantly, it demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of English grammar. Secondly, it put syntax at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. As a result, morphology and phonology were relegated in importance. "Syntactic Structures" also initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between philosophers of language and linguists. American philosopher John Searle wrote that "Chomsky's work is one of the most remarkable intellectual achievements of the present era, comparable in scope and coherence to the work of Keynes or Freud. It has done more than simply produce a revolution in linguistics; it has created a new discipline of generative grammar and is having a revolutionary effect on two other subjects, philosophy and psychology". With its formal and logical treatment of language, Syntactic Structures also brought linguistics and the new field of computer science closer together.

    Chomsky's book on syntactic structures is one of the first serious attempts on the part of a linguist to construct within the tradition of scientific theory-construction a comprehensive theory of language which may be understood in the same sense that a chemical, biological theory is ordinarily understood by experts in those fields. It is not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalog, nor another speculative philosophy about the nature of Man and Language, but rather a rigorous explication of our intuitions about our language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages; and it may well provide an opportunity for the application of explicit measures of simplicity to decide preference of one form over another form of grammar."Robert B. Lees in: 'Language' "I had already decided I wanted to be a linguist when I discovered this book. But it is unlikely that I would have stayed in the field without it. It has been the single most inspiring book on linguistics in my whole career.

Building on the work of French linguist Gustave Guillaume, Making Sense out of Meaning is a speaker-oriented study that describes how speakers form word meaning and not, as in other theories, how listeners interpret the meaning of what they hear. Hirtle develops a general model of the ways in which words and word meaning may be realized in discourse contexts and addresses such issues as the demarcation of polysemy and monosemy, metaphorical meaning, parts of speech, and the concept of conversion or zero derivation. Bringing together both lexical and grammatical components, Hirtle shows that distinct lexical senses can be observed and their relations can be understood by focusing on speakers' use of verbs and nouns. A methodical and thoughtful work, Making Sense out of Meaning situates its central question by recalling traditional views of language‚Äôs relation to thought and argues for meaning as a valid object of scientific inquiry.},

  abstract = {The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of English to appear for over fifteen years, a period which has seen immense developments in linguistic theory at all levels. The principal authors, Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey Pullum, are among the world's leading scholars in this area, and they have benefited from the expertise of an international team of distinguished contributors in preparing what will be the definitive grammar for decades to come. Each chapter comprises core definitions, detailed analyses, notes explaining alternative interpretations of difficult or controversial points, and brief notes on usage and history. Numerous cross-references and an exhaustive index ensure ease of access to information. An introductory section offers guidance as to how best to use the book is provided. Rodney Huddleston was until recently Professor in the Linguistics section of the Department of English at the University of Queensland, Australia, and has been publishing important books and papers on English grammar for thirty years. Geoffrey K. Pullum is Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is the author of 200 articles and books on English grammar and a variety of other topics in theoretical and applied linguistics.

  Although the title may suggest that this is a usage manual or style guide, it is actually a reference work that, in the authors' words, aims to "outline and illustrate the principles that govern the construction of words and sentences ... without recommending or condemning particular usage choices." With help from an impressive group of international scholars, linguistics professors Huddleston (English Grammar: An Outline) and Pullum (Phonetic Symbol Guide) here provide a comprehensive and detailed look at the principles of the English language. Chapters are divided into several subsections, with ample examples and explanations for each concept; both a conceptual and a lexical index are included. Although the writers attempt to "bridge a gap...between traditional grammar and the partial descriptions of English grammar proposed by those working in the field of linguistics," the book leans heavily toward the field of linguistics. This makes it more accessible to the informed student of linguistics than to the simple lover of the English language. It is nevertheless an authoritative addition to the fields of both English grammar and linguistics. Recommended for all academic libraries.},

  abstract = {In a series of cross-cultural investigations of word meaning, Cliff Goddard and Anna Wierzbicka examine key expressions from different domains of the lexicon - concrete, abstract, physical, sensory, emotional, and social. They focus on complex and culturally important words in a range of languages that includes English, Russian, Polish, French, Warlpiri, and Malay. Some are basic like men, women, and children or abstract nouns like trauma and violence; others describe qualities such as hot, hard, and rough, emotions like happiness and sadness, or feelings like pain. They ground their discussions in real examples from different cultures and draw on work ranging from Leibniz, Locke, and Bentham, to popular works such as autobiographies and memoirs, and the Dalai Lama on happiness.

	The book opens with a review of the neglected status of lexical semantics in linguistics. The authors consider a range of analytical issues including lexical polysemy, semantic change, the relationship between lexical and grammatical semantics, and the concepts of semantic molecules and templates. Their fascinating book is for everyone interested in the relations between meaning, culture, ideas, and words.},

Leaders in the field guide the reader through the process of modeling, creating an annotation language, building a corpus and evaluating it for correctness. Essential reading for both computer scientists and linguistic researchers.

	Linguistic annotation is an increasingly important activity in the field of computational linguistics because of its critical role in the development of language models for natural language processing applications. Part one of this book covers all phases of the linguistic annotation process, from annotation scheme design and choice of representation format through both the manual and automatic annotation process, evaluation, and iterative improvement of annotation accuracy.  The second part of the book includes case studies of annotation projects across the spectrum of linguistic annotation types, including morpho-syntactic tagging, syntactic analyses, a range of semantic analyses (semantic roles, named entities, sentiment and opinion), time and event and spatial analyses, and discourse level analyses including discourse structure, co-reference, etc. Each case study addresses the various phases and processes discussed in the chapters of part one.

	Nancy Ide is Professor of Computer Science at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, USA. She has been in the field of computational linguistics for over 30 years and made significant contributions to research in word sense disambiguation, computational lexicography, discourse analysis, and the use of semantic web technologies for language data. She is founder of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), the first major standard for representing electronic language data, and later developed the XML Corpus Encoding Standard (XCES). More recently, she co-developed the ISO LAF/GrAF representation format for linguistically annotated data. She has also developed major corpora for American English, including the Open American National Corpus (OANC) and the Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC), and has been a pioneer in efforts to foster open data and resources.

    Building on the strength of their previous work, especially a grammar of comprehensive English. Unchallenged since its publication in 1972 as the standard reference work in the field, the authors have produced an even more comprehensive and perceptive synthesis of current grammatical description. They have drawn collectively on the most recent research, including new findings not only in grammar but also in the neighboring fields of semantics, pragmatics, and text linguistics.

    Discourse features are prominent throughout, as well as being the theme of an entire chapter entitled from sentence to text. The grammatically analyzed data in the survey of English usage, together with other collections of material, both American and British, has again proved an invaluable source of new insights, and, equally important, has provided authentic examples of use.

It postulates that animals, people, even well designed machines will naturally choose the path of least resistance or "effort". This is perhaps best known or at least documented among researchers in the field of library and information science. Their principle states that an information seeking client will tend to use the most convenient search method, in the least exacting mode available. Information seeking behavior stops as soon as minimally acceptable results are found. This theory holds true regardless of the user's proficiency as a searcher, or their level of subject expertise. The principle of least effort is analogous to the path of least resistance. The principle was studied by linguist George Kingsley Zipf, author of this classic treatment of the subject. He theorized that the distribution of word use was due to the tendency to communicate efficiently with least effort and this theory is known as Zipf's Law.},

Introducing English Linguistics accomplishes this goal in two ways. First, it takes a top-down approach to language, beginning with the largest unit of linguistic structure, the text, and working its way down through successively smaller structures (sentences, words, and finally speech sounds). The advantage of presenting language this way is that students are first given the larger picture - they study language in context - and then see how the smaller pieces of language are a consequence of the larger goals of linguistic communication. Second, the book does not contain invented examples, as is the case with most comparable texts, but instead takes its sample materials from the major computerized databases of spoken and written English, giving students a more realistic view of language.},

  abstract = {Since its first publication, Language Universals and Linguistic Typology has become established as the leading introductory account of one of the most productive areas of linguistics‚Äîthe analysis, comparison, and classification of the common features and forms of the organization of languages. Adopting an approach to the subject pioneered by Greenberg and others, Bernard Comrie is particularly concerned with syntactico-semantic universals, devoting chapters to word order, case making, relative clauses, and causative constructions. His book is informed throughout by the conviction that an exemplary account of universal properties of human language cannot restrict itself to purely formal aspects, nor focus on analysis of a single language. Rather, it must also consider language use, relate formal properties to testable claims about cognition and cognitive development, and treat data from a wide range of languages. This second edition has been revised and updated to take full account of new research in universals and typology in the past decade, and more generally to consider how the approach advocated here relates to recent advances in generative grammatical theory.

  	This book is excellent and should be in every linguist's library. The author follows Greenberg rather than Chomsky in his approach to language universals. You do need some knowledge of linguistics in order to appreciate the book.

  	Bernard Comrie is chair of the department of linguistics at the University of Southern California. He is the author of many publications including Aspect and Tense, and is editor of Studies in Language.},

  abstract = {The theoretical underpinnings of computing form a standard part of almost every computer science curriculum. But the classic treatment of this material isolates it from the myriad ways in which the theory influences the design of modern hardware and software systems. The goal of this book is to change that. The book is organized into a core set of chapters (that cover the standard material suggested by the title), followed by a set of appendix chapters that highlight application areas including programming language design, compilers, software verification, networks, security, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, game playing, and computational biology.

	The core material includes discussions of finite state machines, Markov models, hidden Markov models (HMMs), regular expressions, context-free grammars, pushdown automata, Chomsky and Greibach normal forms, context-free parsing, pumping theorems for regular and context-free languages, closure theorems and decision procedures for regular and context-free languages, Turing machines, nondeterminism, decidability and undecidability, the Church-Turing thesis, reduction proofs, Post Correspondence problem, tiling problems, the undecidability of first-order logic, asymptotic dominance, time and space complexity, the Cook-Levin theorem, NP-completeness, Savitch's Theorem, time and space hierarchy theorems, randomized algorithms and heuristic search. Throughout the discussion of these topics there are pointers into the application chapters. So, for example, the chapter that describes reduction proofs of undecidability has a link to the security chapter, which shows a reduction proof of the undecidability of the safety of a simple protection framework.},

@book{aarts2011oxford,
  abstract = {Written by Bas Aarts, one of Britain's leading grammarians, Oxford Modern English Grammar is a brand new and definitive guide to English grammar. This indispensable handbook covers both British and American English, and makes use of authentic spoken and written examples.

	Packed with tables, diagrams, and numerous example sentences, and assuming no prior knowledge of grammatical concepts on the part of the reader, this volume offers an unmatched guide to the structure of contemporary English. Arranged in three clear parts for ease of use, the Grammar's comprehensive coverage ranges from the very basic--such as word structure, simple and complex phrases, and clause types--to the more sophisticated topics that lie at the intersection of grammar and meaning, including tense and aspect, mood and modality, and information structuring. How do words formed by "compounding" differ from words formed by "conversion"? How many verbs in English can take a declarative clause functioning as direct object (i.e., "decide that..." or "believe that...")? What is the relationship between a matrix clause and a subordinate clause? What is the present futurate? The past futurate? The present perfect? How does the grammar of English encode such semantic notions as "possibility," "probability," "necessity," "obligation," "permission," "intention," or "ability"? Aarts answers all these questions, clearly and engagingly, deeply enriching the reader's understanding of the English language.

	Oxford Modern English Grammar will be invaluable for those with an interest in the English language, undergraduate students of all disciplines, and for anyone who would like a clear guide to English grammar and how to use it.},

@book{leech1983principles,
  abstract = {Over the years, pragmatics - the study of the use and meaning of utterances to their situations - has become a more and more important branch of linguistics, as the inadequacies of a purely formalist, abstract approach to the study of language have become more evident. This book presents a rhetorical model of pragmatics: that is, a model which studies linguistic communication in terms of communicative goals and principles of 'good communicative behavior'.

	In this respect, Geoffrey Leech argues for a rapprochement between linguistics and the traditional discipline of rhetoric. He does not reject the Chomskvan revolution of linguistics, but rather maintains that the language system in the abstract - i.e. the 'grammar' broadly in Chomsky's sense - must be studied in relation to a fully developed theory of language use. There is therefore a division of labor between grammar and rhetoric, or (in the study of meaning) between semantics and pragmatics.

	The book's main focus is thus on the development of a model of pragmatics within an overall functional model of language. In this it builds on the speech act theory of Austin and Searle, and the theory of conversational implicature of Grice, but at the same time enlarges pragmatics to include politeness, irony, phatic communion, and other social principles of linguistic behavior.},

Distinguished scholars from all over the world explain the rationale and aims of over thirty explanatory approaches to the description, analysis, and understanding of language. Each chapter considers the main goals of the model; the relation it proposes from between lexicon, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology; the way it defines the interactions between cognition and grammar; what it counts as evidence; and how it explains linguistic change and structure. The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis offers an indispensable guide for everyone researching any aspect of language including those in linguistics, comparative philology, cognitive science, developmental philology, cognitive science, developmental psychology, computational science, and artificial intelligence.

@book{disciullo1987definition,
  abstract = {On The Definition of Word develops a consistent and coherent approach to central questions about morphology and its relation to syntax. In sorting out the various senses in which the word word is used, it asserts that three concepts which have often been identified with each other are in fact distinct and not coextensive: listemes (linguistic objects permanently stored by the speaker); morphological objects (objects whose shape can be characterized in morphological terms of affixation and compounding); and syntactic atoms (objects that are unanalyzable units with respect to syntax).

	The first chapter defends the idea that listemes are distinct from the other two notions, and that all one can and should say about them is that they exist. A theory of morphological objects is developed in chapter two. Chapter three defends the claim that the morphological objects are a proper subset of the syntactic atoms, presenting the authors' reconstruction of the important and much-debated Lexical Integrity Hypothesis. A final chapter shows that there are syntactic atoms which are not morphological objects.

@book{radford1997syntactic,
  abstract = {For the most part, Andrew Radford's book does an excellent job of bringing someone new to the nuances of syntactic theory up to speed. As someone with only a general background in the field (but also possessing a deep love of syntactic theory), I consider myself to be a very good test subject.

	One of the book's strongest points is Radford's willingness to take the time and space necessary to explain each detailed step in a theory, derivation, etc. Although I did not need all of the detail all of the time, it was easy to skip those parts and move on. For those with VERY little background in syntactic theory, these carefully outlined steps will be quite helpful in understanding where Radford is taking the theories.

	Another item of importance is Radford's occasional display of alternate explanations for certain empirical paradigms. Although even more alternates would have been more satisfying to me, too many would have made the 550-page book too cumbersome for some.

	A third strong point for the book is its generous workbook sections, one for each chapter. In each section, the problems are carefully explained, and the examples are arranged in an order of progressive difficulty. By using the workbook sections, the student can much better grasp the ideas than by simply going over the chapter's supplied paradigms/answers.

	There are, however, a few drawbacks to be kept in mind. First, only the initial (and easiest) of the workbook section's problems typically is given an answer. For a student doing independent study (like me), or for one with a teacher who is inattentive to the workbook section, this poses a major problem in that difficulties cannot be easily rectified. To make matters more confusing, a few of the workbook problems address issues which are not directly commented on in the chapter.

	The other problem I noticed was the book's espousing certain ideas without any explanation thereof. For instance, the book subscribes to the binary merger theory but offers no real reasons for it (and also neglects to offer any current alternatives). This is not an argument against binary merger; I simply maintain that it would have been better for the reader to understand (even very basically) the author's reasoning behind this decision.

	Despite these two problems, however, I highly recommend this text to anyone wishing to enter into the academic world of theoretical syntax and explore many of its nuanced facets.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the technical vocabulary of computer science in order to create a Computer Science Word List (CSWL). The CSWL was intended as a pedagogical tool in the instruction of non-native English speakers who are studying computer science in UK universities. In order to create this technical word list, a corpus of 3,661,337 tokens was compiled from journal articles and conference proceedings covering the 10 sub-disciplines of computer science as defined by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The CSWL was intended to be supplemental to both the General Service List (GSL) (West, 1953) and the Academic Word List (AWL) (Coxhead, 2000) and was created using the criteria established by Coxhead (2000) for word selection. The CSWL contained 433 headwords and in combination with the GSL and AWL accounted for 95.11\% of all tokens in the corpus. This was sufficient to meet the lexical threshold for sufficient understanding of a text as proposed by Laufer (1990). This study also conducted research into the technicality of the CSWL by comparison to other corpora, comparison to a technical dictionary and an investigation of the distribution of its headwords against the BNC frequency bands. Overall, the CSWL was found to be highly technical in nature. The final part of the research looked into the existence of multiword units in computer science literature to build a Computer Science Multi-Word List (CSMWL) from the same corpus. A total of 23 items comprised the CSMWL and they were again chosen using the same criteria of range and frequency as established by Coxhead (2000). The CSMWL showed that whilst multi-word units do exist in computer science literature, they are mostly compound nouns with domain specific meaning.},

  abstract = {Hundreds of thousands of teachers have used this highly practical guide to help K-12 students enlarge their vocabulary and get involved in noticing, understanding, and using new words. Grounded in research, the book explains how to select words for instruction, introduce their meanings, and create engaging learning activities that promote both word knowledge and reading comprehension. The authors are trusted experts who draw on extensive experience in diverse classrooms and schools. Sample lessons and vignettes, children's literature suggestions, end-of-chapter summaries, and "Your Turn" learning activities enhance the book's utility as a classroom resource, professional development tool, or course text.

	One of the 10 Books Every Teacher Should Read

	Reflects over a decade of advances in research-based vocabulary instruction.

	Chapters on vocabulary and writing; assessment; and differentiating instruction for struggling readers and English language learners, including coverage of response to intervention (RTI).

	Expanded discussions of content-area vocabulary and multiple-meaning words.

	Many additional examples showing what robust instruction looks like in action.

	Appendix with a useful menu of instructional activities.

	See also the authors' Creating Robust Vocabulary: Frequently Asked Questions and Extended Examples, which includes specific instructional sequences for different grade ranges, as well as Making Sense of Phonics, Second Edition: The Hows and Whys, by Isabel L. Beck and Mark E. Beck, an invaluable resource for K-3.

	Bringing Words to Life is, without doubt, one of the best and most influential books ever published on the topic of teaching and developing vocabulary. The second edition is even better than the first--it addresses recent issues such as the Common Core and RTI; provides a greater number of helpful, practical examples; addresses vocabulary and writing; takes on the challenge of providing effective vocabulary instruction for struggling readers and English learners; and offers guidance for teaching math, science, and social studies vocabulary in the intermediate grades. This book should be required reading for anyone seeking teacher or reading specialist certification.

	This is a book teachers will read, reread, and refer to many times to nurture a love of language through joyful, robust vocabulary instruction. The authors' research-based insights and advice about selecting words and systematically presenting them to learners from all backgrounds are both practical and manageable. Teachers will delight in nurturing a language-rich classroom where students revel in language, read better and deeper, speak effectively, and write with purpose and clarity.

	It's hard to believe, but the second edition of Bringing Words to Life is even more comprehensive than the first. Beck, McKeown, and Kucan have outdone themselves. Containing real-life examples and easy-to-implement strategies, this book is a 'must have' for vocabulary instruction. It will help teachers greatly as they work to meet the Common Core Standards.

	Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this book is its personal touch--reading it is like having a conversation with the authors about robust vocabulary instruction. The authors share their decision making, offer warnings about potential challenges, encourage thoughtful planning, and insist on follow-through. Teachers are amply supported in their learning by the 'Your Turn' and 'You Try It' features, whether working on their own or in a course on literacy instruction. This is a book designed by teachers for teachers.

	The book offers elementary, middle, and high school teachers concrete suggestions for choosing words and teaching them to students. New chapters in the second edition provide important updates for teachers who are data driven, who have students of varying ability levels and language backgrounds, and who focus on the reading-writing connection. Like the first edition, this book will make a significant contribution to teacher preparation and professional development. Specific recommendations for practice are illustrated with detailed examples of teachers implementing robust vocabulary instruction in their classrooms.

@book{radford1997syntax,
  abstract = {This textbook is a concise, readable introduction to current work in syntactic theory, particularly to Chomsky's Minimalist program. It gives an overview of theoretical concepts and descriptive devices. The discussion is based on varieties of English (Modern Standard, Belfast, Shakespearean, Jamaican Creole) and does not assume prior knowledge of syntax. There are exercises and a glossary. It is an abridged version of Radford's major new textbook Syntactic Theory and the Structure of English: A Minimalist Approach (CUP, 1997).

	Radford is well known for his comprehensible textbooks of generative syntax. This book is very helpful for beginners to get access to Chomsky's revolutionary ideas in his minimalist program (MP), which is radically different from his previous versions of grammar. What is the particular of this book is that the reader does not need to learn Chomsky's arguments starting from his early works. The book leads the reader to the MP in a straightforward way. The book first reviews Chomsky's philosophy of language, and then demonstrates the operation of the principles and parameters in the framework by using the examples which can explain our intuition of English. To reduce the burden of the reader, as he did in his other books, the author uses vivid analogies to illustrate some critical concepts. There are also excises attached to each chapter. Besides, the book includes a glossary of the terms which appear in the book. If you want to learn about the MP or to read Chomsky's latest works, or if you want to find a textbook for your students in the course of generative syntax, this book, I believe, as a warm-up candidate, should be under your consideration.

	Radford's writing is, as always, clear and illuminating. Radford introduces the rationale behind the Minimalist Program and then proceeds to walk the reader through a minimalist analysis of syntactic phenomena in English. His progression goes from elements possibly familiar from similar proposals in other versions of Generative Grammar to new and even polemic proposals. It is an outstanding overview for readers who may not wish to delve into the paraphernalia of constructs and concepts from obsolete prior proposals. Worthy of note is the fact that analysis of Early Modern English and Belfast English are used to contrast and complement Modern English analysis. I wish more scientists and professors had Radford's clarity!},

Some things remain the same, though. Lucene still delivers high-performancesearch features in a disarmingly easy-to-use API. Due to its vibrant and diverseopen-source community of developers and users, Lucene is relentlessly improving,with evolutions to APIs, significant new features such as payloads, and ahuge increase (as much as 8x) in indexing speed with Lucene 2.3.

And with clear writing, reusable examples, and unmatched advice on bestpractices, Lucene in Action, Second Edition is still the definitive guide todeveloping with Lucene.

Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.},

@article{brown2013sound,
  abstract = {An automated sound correspondence-recognition program developed by the authors is applied to a data set consisting of standardized word lists for over half of the world's languages. Online appendices present the results in a compendium of 692 recurrent sound correspondences that contains information about the frequency of occurrence of each correspondence. Applications of the compendium to historical linguistics are proposed. For example, the catalog of correspondences and frequencies facilitates objective assessment of the commonness or rarity of shared phonological innovations cited as evidence for language-family subgrouping. In another analysis, correspondence frequency is used to measure the degree of similarity between different sounds, yielding models for classifying consonants and vowels that substantially agree with articulatory properties. Correspondence-based similarities are also compared with measurements of sound similarity involving factors such as perceptual confusions, speech errors, and cooccurrence patterns in synchronic phonological rules. Sound similarity discerned from both the perception and production of speech is found to correlate to about the same extent with correspondence-based similarities.},

It avoids mathematical argumentation, often a stumbling block for students, teaching algorithmic thought rather than proofs and logic. This approach allows the student to learn a large number of algorithms within a relatively short span of time. Algorithms are explained through brief, informal descriptions, illuminating examples, and practical exercises. The examples and exercises allow readers to understand algorithms intuitively and from different perspectives. Proof sketches, arguing the correctness of an algorithm or explaining the idea behind fundamental results, are also included. An appendix offers pseudocode descriptions of many algorithms.

Distributed algorithms are performed by a collection of computers that send messages to each other or by multiple software threads that use the same shared memory. The algorithms presented in the book are for the most part "classics," selected because they shed light on the algorithmic design of distributed systems or on key issues in distributed computing and concurrent programming.

Distributed Algorithms can be used in courses for upper-level undergraduates or graduate students in computer science, or as a reference for researchers in the field.},

@book{culicover1997principles,
  abstract = {This authoritative survey shows readers how specific methodological assumptions underlie the core analyses on which syntactic theory is based. The author, an internationally respected figure in the field, gives extensive treatment of Government and Binding (GB) theory and summarizes the major proposals and results of Case theory, Theta theory, X' theory, Binding theory, the theory of A- and A' movement, locality conditions, and the theory of Logical Form (LF). He also provides an up-to-date introduction to a number of more recent proposals, including Chomsky's Minminalist Program, Larsonian Shells, and Kaynes's Antisymmetry theory. The most coherent and organized account of syntactic theory currently available, this volume is enhanced by carefully selected and extensive sets of exercises, annotated suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter, and a comprehensive glossary of technical terms.

	I have used this book, along with other similar sources, for writing a parametric grammar of Persian.The book is coherently organized into ten chapters: 1. Foundations Methods, Arguments, 2. Government and Case, 3. Binding Theory, 4. A-Movement, 5. X'-Theory, 6. A'-Movement, 7. Barriers, 8. LF Representation, 9. Binding and Logical Form. 10. Head Movement and Minimalism. Beginning with the second chapter the author picks up a syntactic problem and critically examines the solutions offered by linguists. For instance,in chapter four he concentrates on the analysis of the passive and its properties, namely, the movement of the underlying object into the surface subject position of the sentence in terms of a lexical analysis, a movement hypothesis and a chain relationship.Moreover, at the end of each chapter there are ample exercises from various languages ( except Persian, of course) for readers / students to ponder over. Crucially,readers/students can familiarize themselves with current linguistic as well as syntactic issues and their proposed solutions. Nevertheless, the book suffers from a couple of drawbacks concerning the ultimate plausible solution for each problem and , more significantly, the definition of principles and parameters as a theoretical foundation/ approach selected by the author,as the title suggests.I consider the latter a critical issue because there seems to be a fair degree of consensus among researchers concerning the principles which describe universal properties of grammatical operations or structures.However, differences of opinions arise regarding the parameters and the components of the language in which they have to be found. According to Chomsky, parameters are associated with the principles of Universal Grammar.Other linguists attribute them to the inflectional system of the language, the fictional categories or lexical categories in general.From this book one cannot understand the author's position on the theory of parametrization.

	Since Chomsky established the GB model in the early 1980's, many introductory books have been published. Culicover's book came out by the end of the GB fashion when most people were attracted by Chomsky's new ideas of the minimalist program (MP). However, this book is not out of date at all, since Culicover illustrated the GB theory in a very critical way providing with quite a number of problems which cannot be solved at ease within the GB framework. All those problems are interesting issues that generative syntax has to manage. Though the author gave some suggestions, the issues remained open both to the GB framework and the MP followers. After reading this book, you may realize that the GB model is not as good as most people believe and that the burden of the MP will be heavier when it has to take over what left insolvable in the GB.

@book{wierzbicka1997understanding,
  abstract = {This book develops the dual themes that languages can differ widely in their vocabularies, and are also sensitive indices to the cultures to which they belong. Wierzbicka seeks to demonstrate that every language has "key concepts," expressed in "key words," which reflect the core values of a given culture. She shows that cultures can be revealingly studied, compared, and explained to outsiders through their key concepts, and that the analytical framework necessary for this purpose is provided by the "natural semantic metalanguage," based on lexical universals, that the author and colleagues have developed on the basis of wide-ranging cross-linguistic investigations. Appealing to anthropologists, psychologists, and philosophers as well as linguists, this book demonstrates that cultural patterns can be studied in a verifiable, rigorous, and non-speculative way, on the basis of empirical evidence and in a coherent theoretical framework.},

@book{laney2017infonomics,
  abstract = {The discipline of infonomics takes you beyond thinking and talking about information as an asset to actually valuing and treating it as one. Infonomics provides the foundation and methods for quantifying information asset value and tactics for using information as your competitive edge to drive growth.

Many people have inquired about what compelled me to write a book about infonomics. Moreover, what kind of crazy person decides to write a book in his "spare time" while in a job demanding much more than bankers' hours?

The short answer is that it's been germinating inside me for many years, and kind of bursting to get out. (Yes, much like in the Alien films.) Back in 1999, I casually and kind of tongue-in-cheek coined the "infonomics" term in a META Group research piece, before META was acquired by Gartner, and even before the first incredible Freakonomics book. It took a couple years for me to realize that information isn't formally valued, recognized or reported as an economic asset. From that moment onward, I was on a mission! And for the past couple decades I have been researching, working with clients, developing ideas, and writing articles on this topic among others.

After compiling 3000 articles, papers and ideas in an Evernote folder on the topic of valuing, accounting for, and administering various kinds of assets, and having amassed over 300 examples of organizations monetizing information, it seemed  high time to write a book. Thankfully Gartner has provided me with the ideal platform, surrounding me with dozens of brilliant colleagues and hundreds of enthusiastic clients over the years with whom to further explore and develop the infonomics concept. But being either too busy or too lazy (more likely both) to write three separate books on monetizing, managing, and measuring information as an asset, it's packed it all into a single book. Feel free however to digest it as three separate books, focusing on one part or another, depending upon your role and interests.

What do I hope to achieve from writing the book? In short, it would be great to affect some kind of awakening that provokes further economic expansion at the hands of a growing cadre of infosavvy leaders and their companies. The book isn't about me nor about achieving fame and fortune. (Most Gartner analysts already have all the tech industry notoriety we can handle. And the book is a Gartner book, so no monetization for me no matter how well it sells.) Rather, day in and day out we Gartner analysts speak with clients who are struggling to manage their data better and do more with it. Their organizations put incredible discipline and resources into the handling and leveraging of other business assets, but not so much with their information.

So if there's one question (maybe two) that I would like the book to evoke from business, technology and information leaders, it's this:

Why hasn't our organization been treating information as an asset all along, and how the heck can we hope to thrive, let alone survive, in an increasingly digital world without doing so???

It would be great to see many of you in any of these roles take some of the ideas from the book on just how to do so, implement them, and build on them.

Perhaps the book brings about a revolution of sorts, leading to the recognition of information as an accounting asset, and subject to the same legal treatment as other forms of property. Or maybe the book will compel some bright young economist to expand upon and develop infonomics into a new branch of economics, earning herself a Nobel Prize. But accounting regulations and the field of economics are not really my main concern. More than anything, I'm anxious to see how organizations that internally embrace and execute on these ideas and practices become tomorrow's economic powerhouses.

So I hope you and your organization's other business leaders, technology, data and analytics leaders, and architects (at least) get the book. And that you each find it interesting, informative, and instructive. Or at least one of the above.},

@article{arora2016linear,
  abstract = {Word embeddings are ubiquitous in NLP and information retrieval, but it's unclear what they represent when the word is polysemous, i.e., has multiple senses. Here it is shown that multiple word senses reside in linear superposition within the word embedding and can be recovered by simple sparse coding.

	The success of the method --- which applies to several embedding methods including word2vec --- is mathematically explained using the random walk on discourses model (Arora et al., 2016). A novel aspect of our technique is that each word sense is also accompanied by one of about 2000 discourse atoms that give a succinct description of which other words co-occur with that word sense. Discourse atoms seem of independent interest, and make the method potentially more useful than the traditional clustering-based approaches to polysemy.},

@article{zhu2009introduction,
  abstract = {Semi-supervised learning is a learning paradigm concerned with the study of how computers and natural systems such as humans learn in the presence of both labeled and unlabeled data. Traditionally, learning has been studied either in the unsupervised paradigm (e.g., clustering, outlier detection) where all the data are unlabeled, or in the supervised paradigm (e.g., classification, regression) where all the data are labeled. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to understand how combining labeled and unlabeled data may change the learning behavior, and design algorithms that take advantage of such a combination. Semi-supervised learning is of great interest in machine learning and data mining because it can use readily available unlabeled data to improve supervised learning tasks when the labeled data are scarce or expensive. Semi-supervised learning also shows potential as a quantitative tool to understand human category learning, where most of the input is self-evidently unlabeled. In this introductory book, we present some popular semi-supervised learning models, including self-training, mixture models, co-training and multiview learning, graph-based methods, and semi-supervised support vector machines. For each model, we discuss its basic mathematical formulation. The success of semi-supervised learning depends critically on some underlying assumptions. We emphasize the assumptions made by each model and give counterexamples when appropriate to demonstrate the limitations of the different models. In addition, we discuss semi-supervised learning for cognitive psychology. Finally, we give a computational learning theoretic perspective on semi-supervised learning, and we conclude the book with a brief discussion of open questions in the field.},

	In Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture, Thomas Erl, one of the world‚Äôs top-selling IT authors, teams up with cloud computing experts and researchers to break down proven and mature cloud computing technologies and practices into a series of well-defined concepts, models, technology mechanisms, and technology architectures, all from an industry-centric and vendor-neutral point of view. In doing so, the book establishes concrete, academic coverage with a focus on structure, clarity, and well-defined building blocks for mainstream cloud computing platforms and solutions.

	Subsequent to technology-centric coverage, the book proceeds to establish business-centric models and metrics that allow for the financial assessment of cloud-based IT resources and their comparison to those hosted on traditional IT enterprise premises. Also provided are templates and formulas for calculating SLA-related quality-of-service values and numerous explorations of the SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS delivery models.

Data were collected at an elementary school in the southeastern United States; the methodologies include qualitative interviews, network analysis, and response surface methods. Results revealed that informal leadership and engagement in cliques positively affect the productive capacity of organizations, and that cliques can absorb large amounts of information flow (volatility) thus promoting stable productivity levels. That is, collective, information-processing adaptability fosters stable productivity plateaus that absorb unpredictable demands. Suggestions for practitioners are provided.},

  abstract = {One of the most exciting developments from the world of ideas in decades, presented with panache by two frighteningly brilliant, endearingly unpretentious, and endlessly creative young scientists. -- Steven Pinker, author of The Better Angels of Our Nature

Our society has gone from writing snippets of information by hand to generating a vast flood of 1s and 0s that record almost every aspect of our lives: who we know, what we do, where we go, what we buy, and who we love. This year, the world will generate 5 zettabytes of data. (That is a five with twenty-one zeros after it.) Big data is revolutionizing the sciences, transforming the humanities, and renegotiating the boundary between industry and the ivory tower.

What is emerging is a new way of understanding our world, our past, and possibly, our future. In Uncharted, Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel tell the story of how they tapped into this sea of information to create a new kind of telescope: a tool that, instead of uncovering the motions of distant stars, charts trends in human history across the centuries. By teaming up with Google, they were able to analyze the text of millions of books. The result was a new field of research and a scientific tool, the Google Ngram Viewer, so groundbreaking that its public release made the front page of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe, and so addictive that Mother Jones called it the greatest timewaster in the history of the internet.

Using this scope, Aiden and Michel -- and millions of users worldwide -- are beginning to see answers to a dizzying array of once intractable questions. How quickly does technology spread? Do we talk less about God today? When did people start having sex instead of making love? At what age do the most famous people become famous? How fast does grammar change? Which writers had their works most effectively censored by the Nazis? When did the spelling donut start replacing the venerable doughnut? Can we predict the future of human history? Who is better known -- Bill Clinton or the rutabaga?

All over the world, new scopes are popping up, using big data to quantify the human experience at the grandest scales possible. Yet dangers lurk in this ocean of 1s and 0s -- threats to privacy and the specter of ubiquitous government surveillance. Aiden and Michel take readers on a voyage through these uncharted waters.},

Renowned for her lucid, accessible prose, Epp explains complex, abstract concepts with clarity and precision. This book presents not only the major themes of discrete mathematics, but also the reasoning that underlies mathematical thought. Students develop the ability to think abstractly as they study the ideas of logic and proof. While learning about such concepts as logic circuits and computer addition, algorithm analysis, recursive thinking, computability, automata, cryptography, and combinatorics, students discover that the ideas of discrete mathematics underlie and are essential to the science and technology of the computer age. Overall, Epp's emphasis on reasoning provides students with a strong foundation for computer science and upper-level mathematics courses.},

@book{harari2015sapiens,
  abstract = {From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity‚Äôs creation and evolution‚Äîa #1 international bestseller‚Äîthat explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ‚Äúhuman.‚Äù

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one‚Äîhomo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.

Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.},

Since empirical research supporting this approach is limited, we extend prior work exploring antecedents and outcomes of shared leadership and develop a framework examining its role as a mediator between task and team characteristics (internal team environment, task cohesion and task ambiguity) and task and team-level consequences (task satisfaction, team satisfaction and team performance). Analyzing experimental data through a mixed-methods approach (quantitative via regression-based analysis and qualitative using thematic analysis for unstructured data in NVivo 10), our results indicate that, in the context of a creative task, internal team environment and task cohesion predict shared leadership, which, in turn, determines task satisfaction.

@book{seni2010ensemble,
  abstract = {Ensemble methods have been called the most influential development in Data Mining and Machine Learning in the past decade. They combine multiple models into one usually more accurate than the best of its components. Ensembles can provide a critical boost to industrial challenges -- from investment timing to drug discovery, and fraud detection to recommendation systems -- where predictive accuracy is more vital than model interpretability.

	Ensembles are useful with all modeling algorithms, but this book focuses on decision trees to explain them most clearly. After describing trees and their strengths and weaknesses, the authors provide an overview of regularization -- today understood to be a key reason for the superior performance of modern ensembling algorithms. The book continues with a clear description of two recent developments: Importance Sampling (IS) and Rule Ensembles (RE). IS reveals classic ensemble methods -- bagging, random forests, and boosting -- to be special cases of a single algorithm, thereby showing how to improve their accuracy and speed. REs are linear rule models derived from decision tree ensembles. They are the most interpretable version of ensembles, which is essential to applications such as credit scoring and fault diagnosis. Lastly, the authors explain the paradox of how ensembles achieve greater accuracy on new data despite their (apparently much greater) complexity.

	This book is aimed at novice and advanced analytic researchers and practitioners -- especially in Engineering, Statistics, and Computer Science. Those with little exposure to ensembles will learn why and how to employ this breakthrough method, and advanced practitioners will gain insight into building even more powerful models. Throughout, snippets of code in R are provided to illustrate the algorithms described and to encourage the reader to try the techniques.},

Moreover, nearly all research on shared leadership has adopted a cross-sectional approach. Accordingly, this research examined the effects of shared leadership, commonality, and communication mode on work performance and satisfaction. Using an experimental policy-capturing design, shared leadership, commonality, and communication mode were manipulated. Students (sample 1) and employees (sample 2) evaluated their performance and satisfaction. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that both shared leadership and high commonality had positive effects on team members' intended performance and predicted satisfaction. Moreover, we found that commonality and communication mode had interactive effects. Interestingly, commonality was more important for face-to-face teams than for virtual teams. The results both emphasize the importance of shared leadership and prompt significant recommendations for virtual teamwork.},

@article{rohde2006improved,

One approach to modeling semantic knowledge makes use of hand-constructed networks or trees of interconnected word senses (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, \& Miller, 1990; Jarmasz \& Szpakowicz, 2003). An alternative approach seeks to model word meanings as high-dimensional vectors, which are derived from the cooccurrence of words in unlabeled text corpora (Landauer \& Dumais, 1997; Burgess \& Lund, 1997a). This paper introduces a new vector-space method for deriving word-meanings from large corpora that was inspired by the HAL and LSA models, but which achieves better and more consistent results in predicting human similarity judgments. We explain the new model, known as COALS, and how it relates to prior methods, and then evaluate the various models on a range of tasks, including a novel set of semantic similarity ratings involving both semantically and morphologically related terms.},

To understand how this cascading process operates, we propose that two key characteristics of supervisors, their job satisfaction and empowering leadership behaviors, mediate the linkage between collective strategic visions at these different levels.

The efforts have been institutionalized in places such as usage guides, dictionaries, and school curricula. Such authorities have aspired to 'fix' the language, sometimes by keeping English exactly where it is, but also by trying to improve the current state of the language. Anne Curzan demonstrates the important role prescriptivism plays in the history of the English language, as a sociolinguistic factor in language change and as a vital meta-discourse about language. Starting with a pioneering new definition of prescriptivism as a linguistic phenomenon, she highlights the significant role played by Microsoft's grammar checker, debates about 'real words', non-sexist language reform, and efforts to reappropriate stigmatized terms. Essential reading for anyone interested in the regulation of language, the book is a fascinating re-examination of how we tell language history.},

  abstract = {Changing institutions is an integral part of an academic life. Yet little is known about the mobility patterns of scientists at an institutional level and how these career choices affect scientific outcomes. Here, we examine over 420,000 papers, to track the affiliation information of individual scientists, allowing us to reconstruct their career trajectories over decades. We find that career movements are not only temporally and spatially localized, but also characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional ranking. When cross-group movement occurs, we find that while going from elite to lower-rank institutions on average associates with modest decrease in scientific performance, transitioning into elite institutions does not result in subsequent performance gain. These results offer empirical evidence on institutional level career choices and movements and have potential implications for science policy.},

@book{cameron2012verbal,
  abstract = {In Verbal Hygiene, Deborah Cameron takes a serious look at popular attitudes towards language and examines the practices by which people attempt to regulate its use. Instead of dismissing the practice of ‚Äòverbal hygiene‚Äô, as a misguided and pernicious exercise, she argues that popular discourse about language values ‚Äì good and bad, right and wrong ‚Äì serves an important function for those engaged in it. A series of case studies deal with specific examples of verbal hygiene: the regulation of ‚Äòstyle‚Äô by editors, the teaching of English grammar in schools, the movements for and against so-called ‚Äòpolitically correct‚Äô language and the advice given to women on how they can speak more effectively.

This Routledge Linguistics Classic includes a new foreword which looks at how the issues covered in the case studies have developed over time and a new afterword which discusses new concerns which have emerged in the last 15 years, from the regimentation of language in the workplace to panics about immigration and terrorism, which are expressed in linguistic terms.

Addressed to linguists, to professional language-users of all kinds, and to anyone interested in language and culture, Verbal Hygiene calls for legitimate concerns about language and value to be discussed, by experts and lay-speakers alike, in a rational and critical spirit.},

As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML) -- that has been widely successful in commercial domains -- offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique challenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel problem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.},

In the original HAL model, many parameters were set without any a priori rationale. We have created and publicly released a computer application, the High Dimensional Explorer (HiDEx), that makes it possible to systematically alter the values of these parameters to examine their effect on the co-occurrence matrix that instantiates the model. We took an empirical approach to understanding the influence of the parameters on the measures produced by the models, looking at how well matrices derived with different parameters could predict human reaction times in lexical decision and semantic decision tasks. New parameter sets give us measures of semantic density that improve the model's ability to predict behavioral measures. Implications for such models are discussed.},

Collective capacities emerge when interactions between individuals enact divergent and convergent ways of perceiving and responding to reality. An agent-based flocking model is employed to represent these interactive dynamics and emergent processes. This study explicates the model's constructs, translating its algorithms into behavioral norms at the individual level and its outcomes into collective behaviors at the group level. Phenomena-based simulation modeling links two collective states‚Äîtechnical capacity and adaptive capacity‚Äîto the specific underlying norm configurations from which they emerge. Flock Leadership provides a unique theoretical framing of emergent collective behavior in organizational settings, a new methodology for analyzing relationships between those emergent behavioral patterns and the interaction norms underlying them, and a useful means for identifying leadership opportunities.},

We propose that the literature examining the triadic relationships between epistemology (the nature of knowledge), pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching), and assessment provide critical considerations for bounding this middle space. We provide examples to illustrate the ways in which the understandings of particular analytics are informed by this triad. As a detailed worked example of how one might design analytics to scaffold a specific form of higher order learning, we focus on the construct of epistemic beliefs: beliefs about the nature of knowledge. We argue that analytics grounded in a pragmatic, socio-cultural perspective are well placed to explore this construct using discourse-centric technologies. The examples provided throughout this paper, through emphasizing the consideration of intentional design issues in the middle space, underscore the ''interpretative flexibility'' (Hamilton \& Feenberg, 2005) of new technologies, including analytics.},

@book{mirkin2012clustering,
  abstract = {Often considered more of an art than a science, books on clustering have been dominated by learning through example with techniques chosen almost through trial and error. Even the two most popular, and most related, clustering methods  -- K-Means for partitioning and Ward's method for hierarchical clustering -- have lacked the theoretical underpinning required to establish a firm relationship between the two methods and relevant interpretation aids. Other approaches, such as spectral clustering or consensus clustering, are considered absolutely unrelated to each other or to the two above mentioned methods.

	Clustering: A Data Recovery Approach, Second Edition, presents a unified modeling approach for the most popular clustering methods: the K-Means and hierarchical techniques, especially for divisive clustering. It significantly expands coverage of the mathematics of data recovery, and includes a new chapter covering more recent popular network clustering approaches‚Äïspectral, modularity and uniform, additive, and consensus‚Äïtreated within the same data recovery approach. Another added chapter covers cluster validation and interpretation, including recent developments for ontology-driven interpretation of clusters. Altogether, the insertions added a hundred pages to the book, even in spite of the fact that fragments unrelated to the main topics were removed.

	Illustrated using a set of small real-world datasets and more than a hundred examples, the book is oriented towards students, practitioners, and theoreticians of cluster analysis. Covering topics that are beyond the scope of most texts, the author's explanations of data recovery methods, theory-based advice, pre- and post-processing issues and his clear, practical instructions for real-world data mining make this book ideally suited for teaching, self-study, and professional reference.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive review of an area of machine learning that deals with the use of unlabeled data in classification problems: state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, applications, benchmark experiments, and directions for future research.

In the field of machine learning, semi-supervised learning (SSL) occupies the middle ground, between supervised learning (in which all training examples are labeled) and unsupervised learning (in which no label data are given). Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research.Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semi-supervised learning and transduction.},

In this study, we examine identification with one's organization and work team to predict the presence or absence of a leadership relationship. Using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) we find that employees who strongly identify with their company and team are more likely to view others as a source of leadership. We also find that employees who strongly identify with the organization are more likely to be viewed by others as a source of leadership.

@article{zhao2015analysis,
  abstract = {Citation analysis‚Äîthe exploration of reference patterns in the scholarly and scientific literature‚Äîhas long been applied in a number of social sciences to study research impact, knowledge flows, and knowledge networks. It has important information science applications as well, particularly in knowledge representation and in information retrieval.

Recent years have seen a burgeoning interest in citation analysis to help address research, management, or information service issues such as university rankings, research evaluation, or knowledge domain visualization. This renewed and growing interest stems from significant improvements in the availability and accessibility of digital bibliographic data (both citation and full text) and of relevant computer technologies. The former provides large amounts of data and the latter the necessary tools for researchers to conduct new types of large-scale citation analysis, even without special access to special data collections. Exciting new developments are emerging this way in many aspects of citation analysis.

This book critically examines both theory and practical techniques of citation network analysis and visualization, one of the two main types of citation analysis (the other being evaluative citation analysis). To set the context for its main theme, the book begins with a discussion of the foundations of citation analysis in general, including an overview of what can and what cannot be done with citation analysis (Chapter 1). An in-depth examination of the generally accepted steps and procedures for citation network analysis follows, including the concepts and techniques that are associated with each step (Chapter 2). Individual issues that are particularly important in citation network analysis are then scrutinized, namely: field delineation and data sources for citation analysis (Chapter 3); disambiguation of names and references (Chapter 4); and visualization of citation networks (Chapter 5). Sufficient technical detail is provided in each chapter so the book can serve as a practical how-to guide to conducting citation network analysis and visualization studies.

While the discussion of most of the topics in this book applies to all types of citation analysis, the structure of the text and the details of procedures, examples, and tools covered here are geared to citation network analysis rather than evaluative citation analysis. This conscious choice was based on the authors‚Äô observation that, compared to evaluative citation analysis, citation network analysis has not been covered nearly as well by dedicated books, despite the fact that it has not been subject to nearly as much severe criticism and has been substantially enriched in recent years with new theory and techniques from research areas such as network science, social network analysis, or information visualization.

@article{hlava2014taxobook,
  abstract = {This is the first volume in a series about creating and maintaining taxonomies and their practical applications, especially in search functions.

In Book 1 (The Taxobook: History, Theories, and Concepts of Knowledge Organization), the author introduces the very foundations of classification, starting with the ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle, as well as Theophrastus and the Roman Pliny the Elder. They were first in a line of distinguished thinkers and philosophers to ponder the organization of the world around them and attempt to apply a structure or framework to that world.

The author continues by discussing the works and theories of several other philosophers from Medieval and Renaissance times, including Saints Aquinas and Augustine, William of Occam, Andrea Cesalpino, Carl Linnaeus, and Ren√© Descartes.

In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, James Frederick Ferrier, Charles Ammi Cutter, and Melvil Dewey contributed greatly to the theories of classification systems and knowledge organization. Cutter and Dewey, especially, created systems that are still in use today.

Chapter 8 covers the contributions of Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan, who is considered by many to be the ‚Äúfather of modern library science.‚Äù He created the concept of faceted vocabularies, which are widely used‚Äîeven if they are not well understood‚Äîon many e-commerce websites.

Following the discussions and historical review, the author has included a glossary that covers all three books of this series so that it can be referenced as you work your way through the second and third volumes. The author believes that it is important to understand the history of knowledge organization and the differing viewpoints of various philosophers‚Äîeven if that understanding is only that the differing viewpoints simply exist. Knowing the differing viewpoints will help answer the fundamental questions: Why do we want to build taxonomies? How do we build them to serve multiple points of view?

@book{zhai2016management,
  abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people analyze and manage vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and are accompanied by semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to analysis and management of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.

This book provides a systematic introduction to all these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. The focus is on text mining applications that can help users analyze patterns in text data to extract and reveal useful knowledge. Information retrieval systems, including search engines and recommender systems, are also covered as supporting technology for text mining applications. The book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in text data mining and information retrieval from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of text mining and information retrieval to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. The book can be used as a textbook for a computer science undergraduate course or a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in analyzing and managing text data.},

The assurance includes plans for the sustainability of the repository, the accession of digital records, the management of technology evolution, and the mitigation of the risk of data loss. A detailed assessment is provided by the ISO-16363:2012 standard, "Space data and information transfer systems‚ÄîAudit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories." This book examines whether the ISO specification for trustworthiness can be enforced by computer actionable policies. An implementation of the policies is provided and the policies are sorted into categories for procedures to manage externally generated documents, specify repository parameters, specify preservation metadata attributes, specify audit mechanisms for all preservation actions, specify control of preservation operations, and control preservation properties as technology evolves. An application of the resulting procedures is made to enforce trustworthiness within National Science Foundation data management plans.

@article{saracevic2016notion,
  abstract = {Everybody knows what relevance is. It is a "ya'know" notion, concept, idea‚Äìno need to explain whatsoever. Searching for relevant information using information technology (IT) became a ubiquitous activity in contemporary information society. Relevant information means information that pertains to the matter or problem at hand‚Äîit is directly connected with effective communication. The purpose of this book is to trace the evolution and with it the history of thinking and research on relevance in information science and related fields from the human point of view. The objective is to synthesize what we have learned about relevance in several decades of investigation about the notion in information science. This book deals with how people deal with relevance‚Äîit does not cover how systems deal with relevance; it does not deal with algorithms. Spurred by advances in information retrieval (IR) and information systems of various kinds in handling of relevance, a number of basic questions are raised: But what is relevance to start with? What are some of its properties and manifestations? How do people treat relevance? What affects relevance assessments? What are the effects of inconsistent human relevance judgments on tests of relative performance of different IR algorithms or approaches? These general questions are discussed in detail.

@article{hlava2014taxobook,
  abstract = {This book is the third of a three-part series on taxonomies, and covers putting your taxonomy into use in as many ways as possible to maximize retrieval for your users. Chapter 1 suggests several items to research and consider before you start your implementation and integration process. It explores the different pieces of software that you will need for your system and what features to look for in each.

Chapter 2 launches with a discussion of how taxonomy terms can be used within a workflow, connecting two‚Äîor more‚Äîtaxonomies, and intelligent coordination of platforms and taxonomies. Microsoft SharePoint is a widely used and popular program, and I consider their use of taxonomies in this chapter. Following that is a discussion of taxonomies and semantic integration and then the relationship between indexing and the hierarchy of a taxonomy.

Chapter 3 (‚ÄúHow is a Taxonomy Connected to Search?‚Äù) provides discussions and examples of putting taxonomies into use in practical applications. It discusses displaying content based on search, how taxonomy is connected to search, using a taxonomy to guide a searcher, tools for search, including search engines, crawlers and spiders, and search software, the parts of a search-capable system, and then how to assemble that search-capable system. This chapter also examines how to measure quality in search, the different kinds of search, and theories on search from several famous theoreticians‚Äîtwo from the 18th and 19th centuries, and two contemporary. Following that is a section on inverted files, parsing, discovery, and clustering. While you probably don‚Äôt need a comprehensive understanding of these concepts to build a solid, workable system, enough information is provided for the reader to see how they fit into the overall scheme. This chapter concludes with a look at faceted search and some possibilities for search interfaces.

Chapter 4, ‚ÄúImplementing a Taxonomy in a Database or on a Website,‚Äù starts where many content systems really should‚Äîwith the authors, or at least the people who create the content. This chapter discusses matching up various groups of related data to form connections, data visualization and text analytics, and mobile and e-commerce applications for taxonomies. Finally, Chapter 5 presents some educated guesses about the future of knowledge organization.

@article{yang2016dynamic,
  abstract = {Big data and human-computer information retrieval (HCIR) are changing IR. They capture the dynamic changes in the data and dynamic interactions of users with IR systems. A dynamic system is one which changes or adapts over time or a sequence of events. Many modern IR systems and data exhibit these characteristics which are largely ignored by conventional techniques. What is missing is an ability for the model to change over time and be responsive to stimulus. Documents, relevance, users and tasks all exhibit dynamic behavior that is captured in data sets typically collected over long time spans and models need to respond to these changes. Additionally, the size of modern datasets enforces limits on the amount of learning a system can achieve. Further to this, advances in IR interface, personalization and ad display demand models that can react to users in real time and in an intelligent, contextual way.

In this book we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling, the statistical modeling of IR systems that can adapt to change. We define dynamics, what it means within the context of IR and highlight examples of problems where dynamics play an important role. We cover techniques ranging from classic relevance feedback to the latest applications of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and a handful of useful algorithms and tools for solving IR problems incorporating dynamics.

The theoretical component is based around the Markov Decision Process (MDP), a mathematical framework taken from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables us to construct models that change according to sequential inputs. We define the framework and the algorithms commonly used to optimize over it and generalize it to the case where the inputs aren't reliable. We explore the topic of reinforcement learning more broadly and introduce another tool known as a Multi-Armed Bandit which is useful for cases where exploring model parameters is beneficial. Following this we introduce theories and algorithms which can be used to incorporate dynamics into an IR model before presenting an array of state-of-the-art research that already does, such as in the areas of session search and online advertising.

Change is at the heart of modern Information Retrieval systems and this book will help equip the reader with the tools and knowledge needed to understand Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling.

@article{lalmas2014measuring,
  abstract = {User engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of interacting with an online application and, in particular, the desire to use that application longer and repeatedly. User engagement is a key concept in the design of online applications (whether for desktop, tablet or mobile), motivated by the observation that successful applications are not just used, but are engaged with. Users invest time, attention, and emotion in their use of technology, and seek to satisfy pragmatic and hedonic needs. Measurement is critical for evaluating whether online applications are able to successfully engage users, and may inform the design of and use of applications. User engagement is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon; this gives rise to a number of potential measurement approaches. Common ways to evaluate user engagement include using self-report measures, e.g., questionnaires; observational methods, e.g. facial expression analysis, speech analysis; neuro-physiological signal processing methods, e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular accelerations and decelerations, muscle spasms; and web analytics, e.g., number of site visits, click depth. These methods represent various trade-offs in terms of the setting (laboratory versus ``in the wild''), object of measurement (user behaviour, affect or cognition) and scale of data collected. For instance, small-scale user studies are deep and rich, but limited in terms of generalizability, whereas large-scale web analytic studies are powerful but negate users' motivation and context. The focus of this book is how user engagement is currently being measured and various considerations for its measurement. Our goal is to leave readers with an appreciation of the various ways in which to measure user engagement, and their associated strengths and weaknesses. We emphasize the multifaceted nature of user engagement and the unique contextual constraints that come to bear upon attempts to measure engagement in different settings, and across different user groups and web domains. At the same time, this book advocates for the development of ``good'' measures and good measurement practices that will advance the study of user engagement and improve our understanding of this construct, which has become so vital in our wired world.

  abstract = {Personal Information Management (PIM) is the art of getting things done in our lives through information. How do we - can we better - manage our information at home, at school, at work, at play and "@large" in a global community? How do we use information not only to know but also to represent, communicate and effect useful change in the world around us?

In the study of PIM, does the search for practical methods with practical impact lead to methods that are "massive open on-line"? Can the ancient practice of storytelling help us better to weave our fragmented information together? In the practice of PIM, how can our information best serve as "near knowledge" - close at hand and, through our information tools, serving in practical ways to extend the knowledge that's "in the head"? If attempts to multitask lead to ineffective, even dangerous, instances of task switching and divided attention, can better PIM help us to realize, instead, opportunities for "multi-goaling" where the same time and effort accomplishes not just one but several goals?

These and other questions are addressed in this third and final book to conclude the series on "The Future of Personal Information Management".

Part 1, "Our Information, Always and Forever", covered the fundamentals of PIM and then explored the seismic shift, already well underway, towards a world where our information is always at hand (thanks to our devices) and "forever" on the web.

Part 2, "Transforming Technologies to Manage Our Information", provided a more focused look at technologies for managing information. The opening chapter discussed "natural interface" technologies of input/output to free us from keyboard, screen and mouse. Successive chapters then explored technologies to save, search and structure our information. A concluding chapter introduced the possibility that we may see dramatic reductions in the "clerical tax" we pay as we work with our information.

Now in Part 3, "Building a Better World with Our Information", focus shifts to the practical present and to the near future. Part 3 is in three chapters:

‚Ä¢ Group information management and the social fabric in PIM. How do we preserve and promote our PIM practices as we interact with others at home, at work, at play and in wider, even global, communities? (Chapter 10).

‚Ä¢ Designing for PIM in the development of tools and in the selection of teachable (learnable) "better practices" of PIM. (Chapter 11).

‚Ä¢ To each of us, our own concludes with an exploration of the ways each of us, individually, can develop better practices for the management of our information in service of the lives we wish to live and towards a better world we all must share. (Chapter 12).

Reviews:

William Jones has worked intently on this topic for many years. His coverage is very broad, and he has thought carefully and deeply about the issues, pursuing them to the point where knowledge passes into wisdom. Because each of us is different, and each of us has many different relationships to different categories of information, this is a complex topic with no silver bullet. Yet this book will remain an invaluable resource for a very long time, whether as a foundation for research or as a basis for action, because no one is likely to come along with such a monumental grasp of the subject.-Jonathan T. Grudin (Snippet from Amazon.com Review)},

  abstract = {Information Architecture is about organizing and simplifying information, designing and integrating information spaces/systems, and creating ways for people to find and interact with information content. Its goal is to help people understand and manage information and make the right decisions accordingly. This updated and revised edition of the book looks at integrated information spaces in the web context and beyond, with a focus on putting theories and principles into practice.

In the ever-changing social, organizational, and technological contexts, information architects not only design individual information spaces (e.g., websites, software applications, and mobile devices), but also tackle strategic aggregation and integration of multiple information spaces across websites, channels, modalities, and platforms. Not only do they create predetermined navigation pathways, but they also provide tools and rules for people to organize information on their own and get connected with others.

Information architects work with multi-disciplinary teams to determine the user experience strategy based on user needs and business goals, and make sure the strategy gets carried out by following the user-centered design (UCD) process via close collaboration with others. Drawing on the authors‚Äô extensive experience as HCI researchers, User Experience Design practitioners, and Information Architecture instructors, this book provides a balanced view of the IA discipline by applying theories, design principles, and guidelines to IA and UX practices. It also covers advanced topics such as iterative design, UX decision support, and global and mobile IA considerations. Major revisions include moving away from a web-centric view toward multi-channel, multi-device experiences. Concepts such as responsive design, emerging design principles, and user-centered methods such as Agile, Lean UX, and Design Thinking are discussed and related to IA processes and practices.

@article{kraft2017fuzzy,
  abstract = {Information retrieval used to mean looking through thousands of strings of texts to find words or symbols that matched a user's query. Today, there are many models that help index and search more effectively so retrieval takes a lot less time. Information retrieval (IR) is often seen as a subfield of computer science and shares some modeling, applications, storage applications and techniques, as do other disciplines like artificial intelligence, database management, and parallel computing. This book introduces the topic of IR and how it differs from other computer science disciplines. A discussion of the history of modern IR is briefly presented, and the notation of IR as used in this book is defined. The complex notation of relevance is discussed. Some applications of IR is noted as well since IR has many practical uses today. Using information retrieval with fuzzy logic to search for software terms can help find software components and ultimately help increase the reuse of software. This is just one practical application of IR that is covered in this book.

Some of the classical models of IR is presented as a contrast to extending the Boolean model. This includes a brief mention of the source of weights for the various models. In a typical retrieval environment, answers are either yes or no, i.e., on or off. On the other hand, fuzzy logic can bring in a "degree of" match, vs. a crisp, i.e., strict match. This, too, is looked at and explored in much detail, showing how it can be applied to information retrieval. Fuzzy logic is often times considered a soft computing application and this book explores how IR with fuzzy logic and its membership functions as weights can help indexing, querying, and matching. Since fuzzy set theory and logic is explored in IR systems, the explanation of where the fuzz is ensues.

The concept of relevance feedback, including pseudorelevance feedback is explored for the various models of IR. For the extended Boolean model, the use of genetic algorithms for relevance feedback is delved into.

The concept of query expansion is explored using rough set theory. Various term relationships is modeled and presented, and the model extended for fuzzy retrieval. An example using the UMLS terms is also presented. The model is also extended for term relationships beyond synonyms.

Finally, this book looks at clustering, both crisp and fuzzy, to see how that can improve retrieval performance. An example is presented to illustrate the concepts.

We refer to the term "academic social web platforms" in this book as a category of Web 2.0 tools or online platforms (such as CiteULike, Mendeley, Academia.edu, and ResearchGate) that enable and facilitate scholarly information exchange and participation. We will also examine scholarly collaboration behaviors including sharing academic resources, exchanging opinions, following each other's research, keeping up with current research trends, and, most importantly, building up their professional networks.

Inspired by the model developed Olson et al. [2000] on factors for successful scientific collaboration, our examination of the status of scholarly collaboration on the academic social web has four emphases: technology readiness, coupling work, building common ground, and collaboration readiness. Finally, we talk about the insights and challenges of all these online scholarly collaboration activities imposed on the research communities who are engaging in supporting online scholarly collaboration.

This book aims to help researchers and practitioners understand the development of scholarly collaboration on the academic social web, and to build up an active community of scholars who are interested in this topic.

@article{hlava2014taxobook,
  abstract = {This book outlines the basic principles of creation and maintenance of taxonomies and thesauri. It also provides step by step instructions for building a taxonomy or thesaurus and discusses the various ways to get started on a taxonomy construction project.

Often, the first step is to get management and budgetary approval, so I start this book with a discussion of reasons to embark on the taxonomy journey. From there I move on to a discussion of metadata and how taxonomies and metadata are related, and then consider how, where, and why taxonomies are used.

Information architecture has its cornerstone in taxonomies and metadata. While a good discussion of information architecture is beyond the scope of this work, I do provide a brief discussion of the interrelationships among taxonomies, metadata, and information architecture.

Moving on to the central focus of this book, I introduce the basics of taxonomies, including a definition of vocabulary control and why it is so important, how indexing and tagging relate to taxonomies, a few of the types of tagging, and a definition and discussion of post- and pre-coordinate indexing. After that I present the concept of a hierarchical structure for vocabularies and discuss the differences among various kinds of controlled vocabularies, such as taxonomies, thesauri, authority files, and ontologies.

Once you have a green light for your project, what is the next step? Here I present a few options for the first phase of taxonomy construction and then a more detailed discussion of metadata and markup languages. I believe that it is important to understand the markup languages (SGML and XML specifically, and HTML to a lesser extent) in relation to information structure, and how taxonomies and metadata feed into that structure. After that, I present the steps required to build a taxonomy, from defining the focus, collecting and organizing terms, analyzing your vocabulary for even coverage over subject areas, filling in gaps, creating relationships between terms, and applying those terms to your content. Here I offer a cautionary note: don‚Äôt believe that your taxonomy is ‚Äúdone!‚Äù Regular, scheduled maintenance is an important‚Äîcritical, really‚Äîcomponent of taxonomy construction projects.

After you‚Äôve worked through the steps in this book, you will be ready to move on to integrating your taxonomy into the workflow of your organization. This is covered in Book 3 of this series.

@article{white2009exploratory,
  abstract = {As information becomes more ubiquitous and the demands that searchers have on search systems grow, there is a need to support search behaviors beyond simple lookup. Information seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Exploratory search describes an information-seeking problem context that is open-ended, persistent, and multifaceted, and information-seeking processes that are opportunistic, iterative, and multitactical. Exploratory searchers aim to solve complex problems and develop enhanced mental capacities. Exploratory search systems support this through symbiotic human-machine relationships that provide guidance in exploring unfamiliar information landscapes.

Exploratory search has gained prominence in recent years. There is an increased interest from the information retrieval, information science, and human-computer interaction communities in moving beyond the traditional turn-taking interaction model supported by major Web search engines, and toward support for human intelligence amplification and information use. In this lecture, we introduce exploratory search, relate it to relevant extant research, outline the features of exploratory search systems, discuss the evaluation of these systems, and suggest some future directions for supporting exploratory search. Exploratory search is a new frontier in the search domain and is becoming increasingly important in shaping our future world.

@article{lalmas2009retrieval,
  abstract = {Documents usually have a content and a structure. The content refers to the text of the document, whereas the structure refers to how a document is logically organized. An increasingly common way to encode the structure is through the use of a mark-up language. Nowadays, the most widely used mark-up language for representing structure is the eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML). XML can be used to provide a focused access to documents, i.e. returning XML elements, such as sections and paragraphs, instead of whole documents in response to a query. Such focused strategies are of particular benefit for information repositories containing long documents, or documents covering a wide variety of topics, where users are directed to the most relevant content within a document. The increased adoption of XML to represent a document structure requires the development of tools to effectively access documents marked-up in XML. This book provides a detailed description of query languages, indexing strategies, ranking algorithms, presentation scenarios developed to access XML documents. Major advances in XML retrieval were seen from 2002 as a result of INEX, the Initiative for Evaluation of XML Retrieval. INEX, also described in this book, provided test sets for evaluating XML retrieval effectiveness. Many of the developments and results described in this book were investigated within INEX.

The current challenge is to select which one to use, out of the range of available tools. This choice may depend on several aspects, including the kind and source of text, where the level, formal or informal, may influence the performance of such tools. In this paper, we assess a range of natural language processing toolkits with their default configuration, while performing a set of standard tasks (e.g. tokenization, POS tagging, chunking and NER), in popular datasets that cover newspaper and social network text. The obtained results are analyzed and, while we could not decide on a single toolkit, this exercise was very helpful to narrow our choice.},

@article{wu2018mobile,
  abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile Internet and smart personal devices in recent years, mobile search has gradually emerged as a key method with which users seek online information. In addition, cross-device search also has been regarded recently as an important research topic. As more mobile applications (APPs) integrate search functions, a user's mobile search behavior on different APPs becomes more significant. This book provides a systematic review of current mobile search analysis and studies user mobile search behavior from several perspectives, including mobile search context, APP usage, and different devices. Two different user experiments to collect user behavior data were conducted. Then, through the data from user mobile phone usage logs in natural settings, we analyze the mobile search strategies employed and offer a context-based mobile search task collection, which then can be used to evaluate the mobile search engine. In addition, we combine mobile search with APP usage to give more in-depth analysis, such as APP transition in mobile search and follow-up actions triggered by mobile search. The study, combining the mobile search with APP usage, can contribute to the interaction design of APPs, such as the search recommendation and APP recommendation. Addressing the phenomenon of users owning more smart devices today than ever before, we focus on user cross-device search behavior. We model the information preparation behavior and information resumption behavior in cross-device search and evaluate the search performance in cross-device search. Research on mobile search behaviors across different devices can help to understand online user information behavior comprehensively and help users resume their search tasks on different devices.

@article{williams2016syntaxbased,
  abstract = {This unique book provides a comprehensive introduction to the most popular syntax-based statistical machine translation models, filling a gap in the current literature for researchers and developers in human language technologies. While phrase-based models have previously dominated the field, syntax-based approaches have proved a popular alternative, as they elegantly solve many of the shortcomings of phrase-based models. The heart of this book is a detailed introduction to decoding for syntax-based models.

The book begins with an overview of synchronous-context free grammar (SCFG) and synchronous tree-substitution grammar (STSG) along with their associated statistical models. It also describes how three popular instantiations (Hiero, SAMT, and GHKM) are learned from parallel corpora. It introduces and details hypergraphs and associated general algorithms, as well as algorithms for decoding with both tree and string input. Special attention is given to efficiency, including search approximations such as beam search and cube pruning, data structures, and parsing algorithms. The book consistently highlights the strengths (and limitations) of syntax-based approaches, including their ability to generalize phrase-based translation units, their modeling of specific linguistic phenomena, and their function of structuring the search space.

@book{rijsbergen1979information,
  abstract = {In recent years, there have been several attempts to define a logic for information retrieval (IR). The aim was to provide a rich and uniform representation of information and its semantics with the goal of improving retrieval effectiveness. The basis of a logical model for IR is the assumption that queries and documents can be represented effectively by logical formulae. To retrieve a document, an IR system has to infer the formula representing the query from the formula representing the document. This logical interpretation of query and document emphasizes that relevance in IR is an inference process.

  The use of logic to build IR models enables one to obtain models that are more general than earlier well-known IR models. Indeed, some logical models are able to represent within a uniform framework various features of IR systems such as hypermedia links, multimedia data, and user's knowledge. Logic also provides a common approach to the integration of IR systems with logical database systems. Finally, logic makes it possible to reason about an IR model and its properties. This latter possibility is becoming increasingly more important since conventional evaluation methods, although good indicators of the effectiveness of IR systems, often give results which cannot be predicted, or for that matter satisfactorily explained.

  However, logic by itself cannot fully model IR. The success or the failure of the inference of the query formula from the document formula is not enough to model relevance in IR. It is necessary to take into account the uncertainty inherent in such an inference process. In 1986, Van Rijsbergen proposed the uncertainty logical principle to model relevance as an uncertain inference process. When proposing the principle, Van Rijsbergen was not specific about which logic and which uncertainty theory to use. As a consequence, various logics and uncertainty theories have been proposed and investigated. The choice of an appropriate logic and uncertainty mechanism has been a main research theme in logical IR modeling leading to a number of logical IR models over the years.

  Information Retrieval: Uncertainty and Logics contains a collection of exciting papers proposing, developing and implementing logical IR models. This book is appropriate for use as a text for a graduate-level course on Information Retrieval or Database Systems, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.},

  abstract = {IBM Content Analytics provides a UIMA compliant analytics engine and rich platform for deploying text analytic solutions.

  Content Analytics is a platform to derive rapid insight. It can transform raw information into business insight quickly without building models or deploying complex systems enabling all knowledge workers to derive insight in hours or days ... not weeks or months. Flexible and extensible for deeper insights, Content Analytics enables better decision making by deriving valuable insights from your enterprise content regardless of source or format. It allows deep, rich text analysis of your information. Solutions built on Content Analytics can help organizations surface undetected problems, fix content-centric process inefficiencies, improve customer service and corporate accountability, reduce operating costs and risks and discover new revenue opportunities.

  Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an open framework for building analytic applications - to find latent meaning, relationships and relevant facts hidden in unstructured text. UIMA defines a common, standard interface that enables text analytics components from multiple vendors to work together. It provides tools for either creating new interoperable text analytics modules or enabling existing text analytics investments to operate within the framework.

  Although UIMA originated at IBM, it has now moved on to be an Open Source project at the Apache Software Foundation. UIMA is the only recognized standard for semantic search and content analytics, by OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards).

  Content Analytics can analyze documents, comment and note fields, problem reports, e-mail, web sites and other text-based information sources. Sample Applications

  Product defect detection. Analysis of service and maintenance records provides early insight into product defects and service issues before they become widespread, thus enabling quicker resolution and lower after market service and recall costs.

  Insurance fraud analysis. Analysis of claims documentation, policies, and other customer information allows organizations to identify patterns and hidden relationships in claims activities to reduce incidents of fraud and unnecessary payouts.

  Advanced intelligence for anti-terrorism and law enforcement. Analysts can uncover hidden patterns and identify potential criminal or terrorist activity by better analysis of various information sources such as field analyst reports, surveillance transcripts, public records and financial transactions.

  Customer support and self-service. Analysis of call center logs, support e-mails, and other support documentation provides more accurate problem identification to better identify appropriate resolutions.

  e-Commerce and product finders. Customers can find both target and complementary products online, and sales reps can make the right cross-sell offer by identifying relationships and concepts from analysis of product content, customer profiles and sales notes.},

This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

This distribution approximately follows a simple mathematical form known as Zipf's law. This article first shows that human language has a highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, although prior data visualization methods have obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf's law and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf's law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts or is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf's law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

@article{wilson2011search,
  abstract = {Search User Interfaces (SUIs) represent the gateway between people who have a task to complete, and the repositories of information and data stored around the world. Not surprisingly, therefore, there are many communities who have a vested interest in the way SUIs are designed. There are people who study how humans search for information, and people who study how humans use computers. There are people who study good user interface design, and people who design aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. There are also people who curate and manage valuable information resources, and people who design effective algorithms to retrieve results from them. While it would be easy for one community to reject another for their limited ability to design a good SUI, the truth is that they all can, and they all have made valuable contributions. Fundamentally, therefore, we must accept that designing a great SUI means leveraging the knowledge and skills from all of these communities.

The aim of this book is to at least acknowledge, if not integrate, all of these perspectives to bring the reader into a multidisciplinary mindset for how we should think about SUI design. Further, this book aims to provide the reader with a framework for thinking about how different innovations each contribute to the overall design of a SUI. With this framework and a multidisciplinary perspective in hand, the book then continues by reviewing: early, successful, established, and experimental concepts for SUI design. The book then concludes by discussing how we can analyse and evaluate the on-going developments in SUI design, as this multidisciplinary area of research moves forwards. Finally, in reviewing these many SUIs and SUI features, the book finishes by extracting a series of 20 SUI design recommendations that are listed in the conclusions.

  abstract = {Thanks to the availability of texts on the Web in recent years, increased knowledge and information have been made available to broader audiences. However, the way in which a text is written‚Äîits vocabulary, its syntax‚Äîcan be difficult to read and understand for many people, especially those with poor literacy, cognitive or linguistic impairment, or those with limited knowledge of the language of the text. Texts containing uncommon words or long and complicated sentences can be difficult to read and understand by people as well as difficult to analyze by machines. Automatic text simplification is the process of transforming a text into another text which, ideally conveying the same message, will be easier to read and understand by a broader audience. The process usually involves the replacement of difficult or unknown phrases with simpler equivalents and the transformation of long and syntactically complex sentences into shorter and less complex ones. Automatic text simplification, a research topic which started 20 years ago, now has taken on a central role in natural language processing research not only because of the interesting challenges it posesses but also because of its social implications. This book presents past and current research in text simplification, exploring key issues including automatic readability assessment, lexical simplification, and syntactic simplification. It also provides a detailed account of machine learning techniques currently used in simplification, describes full systems designed for specific languages and target audiences, and offers available resources for research and development together with text simplification evaluation techniques.

We derive term-weighting models by measuring the divergence of the actual term distribution from that obtained under a random process. Among the random processes we study the binomial distribution and Bose--Einstein statistics. We define two types of term frequency normalization for tuning term weights in the document--query matching process. The first normalization assumes that documents have the same length and measures the information gain with the observed term once it has been accepted as a good descriptor of the observed document. The second normalization is related to the document length and to other statistics. These two normalization methods are applied to the basic models in succession to obtain weighting formulae. Results show that our framework produces different nonparametric models forming baseline alternatives to the standard tf-idf model.},

@article{agarwal2017exploring,
  abstract = {The field of human information behavior runs the gamut of processes from the realization of a need or gap in understanding, to the search for information from one or more sources to fill that gap, to the use of that information to complete a task at hand or to satisfy a curiosity, as well as other behaviors such as avoiding information or finding information serendipitously. Designers of mechanisms, tools, and computer-based systems to facilitate this seeking and search process often lack a full knowledge of the context surrounding the search. This context may vary depending on the job or role of the person; individual characteristics such as personality, domain knowledge, age, gender, perception of self, etc.; the task at hand; the source and the channel and their degree of accessibility and usability; and the relationship that the seeker shares with the source. Yet researchers have yet to agree on what context really means. While there have been various research studies incorporating context, and biennial conferences on context in information behavior, there lacks a clear definition of what context is, what its boundaries are, and what elements and variables comprise context.

In this book, we look at the many definitions of and the theoretical and empirical studies on context, and I attempt to map the conceptual space of context in information behavior. I propose theoretical frameworks to map the boundaries, elements, and variables of context. I then discuss how to incorporate these frameworks and variables in the design of research studies on context. We then arrive at a unified definition of context. This book should provide designers of search systems a better understanding of context as they seek to meet the needs and demands of information seekers. It will be an important resource for researchers in Library and Information Science, especially doctoral students looking for one resource that covers an exhaustive range of the most current literature related to context, the best selection of classics, and a synthesis of these into theoretical frameworks and a unified definition. The book should help to move forward research in the field by clarifying the elements, variables, and views that are pertinent. In particular, the list of elements to be considered, and the variables associated with each element will be extremely useful to researchers wanting to include the influences of context in their studies.

  The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), a yearly workshop hosted by the US government's National Institute of Standards and Technology, provides the infrastructure necessary for large-scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies. With the goal of accelerating research in this area, TREC created the first large test collections of full-text documents and standardized retrieval evaluation. The impact has been significant; since TREC's beginning in 1992, retrieval effectiveness has approximately doubled. TREC has built a variety of large test collections, including collections for such specialized retrieval tasks as cross-language retrieval and retrieval of speech. Moreover, TREC has accelerated the transfer of research ideas into commercial systems, as demonstrated in the number of retrieval techniques developed in TREC that are now used in Web search engines.This book provides a comprehensive review of TREC research, summarizing the variety of TREC results, documenting the best practices in experimental information retrieval, and suggesting areas for further research.

  The first part of the book describes TREC's history, test collections, and retrieval methodology. Next, the book provides "track" reports‚Äïdescribing the evaluations of specific tasks, including routing and filtering, interactive retrieval, and retrieving noisy text. The final part of the book offers perspectives on TREC from such participants as Microsoft Research, University of Massachusetts, Cornell University, University of Waterloo, City University of New York, and IBM.

  abstract = {This thesis devises a novel methodology based on probability theory, suitable for the construction of term-weighting models of Information Retrieval. Our term-weighting functions are created within a general framework made up of three components. Each of the three components is built independently from the others. We obtain the term-weighting functions from the general model in a purely theoretic way instantiating each component with different probability distribution forms. The thesis begins with investigating the nature of the statistical inference involved in Information Retrieval. We explore the estimation problem underlying the process of sampling. De Finetti‚Äôs theorem is used to show how to convert the frequentist approach into Bayesian inference and we display and employ the derived estimation techniques in the context of Information Retrieval. We initially pay a great attention to the construction of the basic sample spaces of Information Retrieval. The notion of single or multiple sampling from different populations in the context of Information Retrieval is extensively discussed and used through-out the thesis. The language modelling approach and the standard probabilistic model are studied under the same foundational view and are experimentally compared to the divergence-from-randomness approach. In revisiting the main information retrieval models in the literature, we show that even language modelling approach can be exploited to assign term-frequency normalization to the models of divergence from randomness. We finally introduce a novel framework for the query expansion. This framework is based on the models of divergence-from-randomness and it can be applied to arbitrary models of IR, divergence-based, language modelling and probabilistic models included. We have done a very large number of experiment and results show that the framework generates highly effective Information Retrieval models.},

The coverage of topics is heavily slanted towards practical applications--editting and formatting, compression, encryption, file access, information retrieval, indexing, abstracting, spell checking, syntax and style checking--rather than towards theoretical background. That's not a bad thing, though--for many of those topics, this might be the most accessible resource you'll find.

  The book was published in the late 80's, and hence is a bit dated by now -- for instance, the statistical revolution in NLP pretty much is not covered (Bayes does not even show up in the index). However, that in no way detracts from the value of what IS covered.},

  abstract = {Providing an easily accessible data service with high quality data is important for building big data applications. In this paper, we introduce a big data service for managing and accessing massive-scale biomedical image data. The service includes three major components: a NoSQL database for storing images and data analytics results, a client consisting of a group of query scripts for data access and management, and a data quality enhancement component for improving the performance of data analytics. Low-quality data can result in incorrect analytics results and may lead to no value even harmful conclusions. Therefore, it is important to provide an effective mechanism for ensuring data quality improvement in a big data service. We describe the implement ion of a deep learning classifier to automatically filter low quality data in datasets. To improve the effectiveness of data separation, the classifier is rigorously validated with synthetic data generated by a collection of scientific tools. Design of big data services with data quality improvement as an integral component, along with the best practices collected from this experimental study, will help researchers and practitioners to develop strategies for improving the quality of big data services, building big data applications, and designing machine learning classifiers.},

In this study, we re-examine this assumption and show that it does not hold in reality - many expansion terms identified in traditional approaches are indeed unrelated to the query and harmful to the retrieval. We also show that good expansion terms cannot be distinguished from bad ones merely on their distributions in the feedback documents and in the whole collection. We then propose to integrate a term classification process to predict the usefulness of expansion terms. Multiple additional features can be integrated in this process. Our experiments on three TREC collections show that retrieval effectiveness can be much improved when term classification is used. In addition, we also demonstrate that good terms should be identified directly according to their possible impact on the retrieval effectiveness, i.e. using supervised learning, instead of unsupervised learning.},

  abstract = {Relevant Search demystifies relevance work. Using Elasticsearch, it teaches you how to return engaging search results to your users, helping you understand and leverage the internals of Lucene-based search engines.

  Users are accustomed to and expect instant, relevant search results. To achieve this, you must master the search engine. Yet for many developers, relevance ranking is mysterious or confusing.

  Relevant Search demystifies the subject and shows you that a search engine is a programmable relevance framework. You will learn how to apply Elasticsearch or Solr to your business's unique ranking problems. The book demonstrates how to program relevance and how to incorporate secondary data sources, taxonomies, text analytics, and personalization. In practice, a relevance framework requires softer skills as well, such as collaborating with stakeholders to discover the right relevance requirements for your business. By the end, you will be able to achieve a virtuous cycle of provable, measurable relevance improvements over a search product's lifetime.

  What is Inside

  Techniques for debugging relevance?
  Applying search engine features to real problems?
  Using the user interface to guide searchers?
  A systematic approach to relevance?

@article{chuklin2015click,
  abstract = {With the rapid growth of web search in recent years the problem of modeling its users has started to attract more and more attention of the information retrieval community. This has several motivations. By building a model of user behavior we are essentially developing a better understanding of a user, which ultimately helps us to deliver a better search experience. A model of user behavior can also be used as a predictive device for non-observed items such as document relevance, which makes it useful for improving search result ranking. Finally, in many situations experimenting with real users is just infeasible and hence user simulations based on accurate models play an essential role in understanding the implications of algorithmic changes to search engine results or presentation changes to the search engine result page.

In this survey we summarize advances in modeling user click behavior on a web search engine result page. We present simple click models as well as more complex models aimed at capturing non-trivial user behavior patterns on modern search engine result pages. We discuss how these models compare to each other, what challenges they have, and what ways there are to address these challenges. We also study the problem of evaluating click models and discuss the main applications of click models.

@article{heinz2015grammatical,
  abstract = {This book provides a thorough introduction to the subfield of theoretical computer science known as grammatical inference from a computational linguistic perspective. Grammatical inference provides principled methods for developing computationally sound algorithms that learn structure from strings of symbols. The relationship to computational linguistics is natural because many research problems in computational linguistics are learning problems on words, phrases, and sentences: What algorithm can take as input some finite amount of data (for instance a corpus, annotated or otherwise) and output a system that behaves "correctly" on specific tasks?

Throughout the text, the key concepts of grammatical inference are interleaved with illustrative examples drawn from problems in computational linguistics. Special attention is paid to the notion of "learning bias." In the context of computational linguistics, such bias can be thought to reflect common (ideally universal) properties of natural languages. This bias can be incorporated either by identifying a learnable class of languages which contains the language to be learned or by using particular strategies for optimizing parameter values. Examples are drawn largely from two linguistic domains (phonology and syntax) which span major regions of the Chomsky Hierarchy (from regular to context-sensitive classes). The conclusion summarizes the major lessons and open questions that grammatical inference brings to computational linguistics.

Document length normalization is used to fairly retrieve documents of all lengths. In this study, we observe that a normalization scheme that retrieves documents of all lengths with similar chances as their likelihood of relevance will outperform another scheme which retrieves documents with chances very different from their likelihood of relevance. We show that the retrieval probabilities for a particular normalization method deviate systematically from the relevance probabilities across different collections. We present pivoted normalization, a technique that can be used to modify any normalization function thereby reducing the gap between the relevance and the retrieval probabilities. Training pivoted normalization on one collection, we can successfully use it on other (new) text collections, yielding a robust, collection-independent normalization technique. We use the idea of pivoting with the well known cosine normalization function. We point out some shortcomings of the cosine function and present two new normalization functions -- pivoted unique normalization and pivoted byte size normalization.},

The resulting search engine query logs are valuable resources that can be used to predict how people interact with the search system. In this paper, we introduce two novel applications of query logs, in the context of distributed information retrieval. First, we use query log terms to guide sampling from uncooperative distributed collections. We show that while our sampling strategy is at least as efficient as current methods, it consistently performs better. Second, we propose and evaluate a pruning strategy that uses query log information to eliminate terms. Our experiments show that our proposed pruning method maintains the accuracy achieved by complete indexes, while decreasing the index size by up to 60%. While such pruning may not always be desirable in practice, it provides a useful benchmark against which other pruning strategies can be measured.},

The main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori. For this reason, the vector space model adopted by Salton for the SMART system treats the terms as a set of orthogonal vectors. In such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate, corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms. In this paper, we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector space model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic indexing scheme. We also demonstrate how such correlations can be included with minimal modification in the existing vector based information retrieval systems. The preliminary experimental results obtained from the new model are very encouraging.},

Over the last several decades, we have developed a modern science and technology for information retrieval, relentlessly pursuing the vision of a "memex" that Vannevar Bush proposed in his seminal article, "As We May Think."

Faceted search plays a key role in this program. Faceted search addresses weaknesses of conventional search approaches and has emerged as a foundation for interactive information retrieval. User studies demonstrate that faceted search provides more effective information-seeking support to users than best-first search. Indeed, faceted search has become increasingly prevalent in online information access systems, particularly for e-commerce and site search.

In this lecture, we explore the history, theory, and practice of faceted search. Although we cannot hope to be exhaustive, our aim is to provide sufficient depth and breadth to offer a useful resource to both researchers and practitioners. Because faceted search is an area of interest to computer scientists, information scientists, interface designers, and usability researchers, we do not assume that the reader is a specialist in any of these fields. Rather, we offer a self-contained treatment of the topic, with an extensive bibliography for those who would like to pursue particular aspects in more depth.

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of recent developments in mainmemory database systems. With growing memory sizes and memory prices dropping by a factor of 10 every 5 years, data having a ‚Äúprimary home‚Äù in memory is now a reality. Main-memory databases eschew many of the traditional architectural pillars of relational database systems that optimized for disk-resident data. The result of these memory-optimized designs are systems that feature several innovative approaches to fundamental issues (e.g., concurrency control, query processing) that achieve orders of magnitude performance improvements over traditional designs. Our survey covers five main issues and architectural choices that need to be made when building a high performance main-memory optimized database: data organization and storage, indexing, concurrency control, durability and recovery techniques, and query processing and compilation. We focus our survey on four commercial and research systems: H-Store/VoltDB, Hekaton, HyPer, and SAP HANA. These systems are diverse in their design choices and form a representative sample of the state of the art in main-memory database systems. We also cover other commercial and academic systems, along with current and future research trends.},

@article{robertson2010probabilistic,

In recent years, research in the PRF has yielded new retrieval models capable of taking into account document meta-data (especially structure and link-graph information). Again, this has led to one of the most successful Web-search and corporate-search algorithms, BM25F. This work presents the PRF from a conceptual point of view, describing the probabilistic modeling assumptions behind the framework and the different ranking algorithms that result from its application: the binary independence model, relevance feedback models, BM25 and BM25F. It also discusses the relation between the PRF and other statistical models for IR, and covers some related topics, such as the use of non-textual features, and parameter optimization for models with free parameters.},

  abstract = {The language modeling approach to retrieval has been shown to perform well empirically. One advantage of this new approach is its statistical foundations. However, feedback, as one important component in a retrieval system, has only been dealt with heuristically in this new retrieval approach: the original query is usually literally expanded by adding additional terms to it. Such expansion-based feedback creates an inconsistent interpretation of the original and the expanded query. In this paper, we present a more principled approach to feedback in the language modeling approach. Specifically, we treat feedback as updating the query language model based on the extra evidence carried by the feedback documents. Such a model-based feedback strategy easily fits into an extension of the language modeling approach. We propose and evaluate two different approaches to updating a query language model based on feedback documents, one based on a generative probabilistic model of feedback documents and one based on minimization of the KL-divergence over feedback documents. Experimental results show that both approaches are effective and outperform the Rocchio feedback approach.},

A number of query expansion methods have been proposed in traditional information retrieval. However, these previous methods do not take into account the specific characteristics of web searching; in particular, of the availability of large amount of user interaction information recorded in the web query logs. In this study, we propose a new method for query expansion based on query logs. The central idea is to extract probabilistic correlations between query terms and document terms by analyzing query logs. These correlations are then used to select high-quality expansion terms for new queries. The experimental results show that our log-based probabilistic query expansion method can greatly improve the search performance and has several advantages over other existing methods.},

@article{lux2013visual,
  abstract = {Visual information retrieval (VIR) is an active and vibrant research area, which attempts at providing means for organizing, indexing, annotating, and retrieving visual information (images and videos) from large, unstructured repositories.

The goal of VIR is to retrieve matches ranked by their relevance to a given query, which is often expressed as an example image and/or a series of keywords. During its early years (1995-2000), the research efforts were dominated by content-based approaches contributed primarily by the image and video processing community. During the past decade, it was widely recognized that the challenges imposed by the lack of coincidence between an image's visual contents and its semantic interpretation, also known as semantic gap, required a clever use of textual metadata (in addition to information extracted from the image's pixel contents) to make image and video retrieval solutions efficient and effective. The need to bridge (or at least narrow) the semantic gap has been one of the driving forces behind current VIR research. Additionally, other related research problems and market opportunities have started to emerge, offering a broad range of exciting problems for computer scientists and engineers to work on.

In this introductory book, we focus on a subset of VIR problems where the media consists of images, and the indexing and retrieval methods are based on the pixel contents of those images -- an approach known as content-based image retrieval (CBIR). We present an implementation-oriented overview of CBIR concepts, techniques, algorithms, and figures of merit. Most chapters are supported by examples written in Java, using Lucene (an open-source Java-based indexing and search implementation) and LIRE (Lucene Image REtrieval), an open-source Java-based library for CBIR.

The science is driven by the data and is being termed as data science. In this internet age, the volume of the data has grown up to petabytes, and this large, complex, structured or unstructured, and heterogeneous data in the form of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù has gained significant attention. The rapid pace of data growth through various disparate sources, especially social media such as Facebook, has seriously challenged the data analytic capabilities of traditional relational databases. The velocity of the expansion of the amount of data gives rise to a complete paradigm shift in how new age data is processed. Confidence in the data engineering of the existing data processing systems is gradually fading whereas the capabilities of the new techniques for capturing, storing, visualizing, and analyzing data are evolving. In this review paper, we discuss some of the modern Big Data models that are leading contributors in the NoSQL era and claim to address Big Data challenges in reliable and efficient ways. Also, we take the potential of Big Data into consideration and try to reshape the original operational oriented definition of ‚ÄúBig Science‚Äù (Furner, 2003) into a new data-driven definition and rephrase it as ‚ÄúThe science that deals with Big Data is Big Science.‚Äù},

  abstract = {Evaluation has always played a major role in information retrieval, with the early pioneers such as Cyril Cleverdon and Gerard Salton laying the foundations for most of the evaluation methodologies in use today. The retrieval community has been extremely fortunate to have such a well-grounded evaluation paradigm during a period when most of the human language technologies were just developing. This lecture has the goal of explaining where these evaluation methodologies came from and how they have continued to adapt to the vastly changed environment in the search engine world today.

The lecture starts with a discussion of the early evaluation of information retrieval systems, starting with the Cranfield testing in the early 1960s, continuing with the Lancaster "user" study for MEDLARS, and presenting the various test collection investigations by the SMART project and by groups in Britain. The emphasis in this chapter is on the how and the why of the various methodologies developed. The second chapter covers the more recent batch evaluations, examining the methodologies used in the various open evaluation campaigns such as TREC, NTCIR (emphasis on Asian languages), CLEF (emphasis on European languages), INEX (emphasis on semi-structured data), etc. Here again the focus is on the how and why, and in particular on the evolving of the older evaluation methodologies to handle new information access techniques. This includes how the test collection techniques were modified and how the metrics were changed to better reflect operational environments. The final chapters look at evaluation issues in user studies -- the interactive part of information retrieval, including a look at the search log studies mainly done by the commercial search engines. Here the goal is to show, via case studies, how the high-level issues of experimental design affect the final evaluations.

  abstract = {We are poised at a major turning point in the history of information management via computers. Recent evolutions in computing, communications, and commerce are fundamentally reshaping the ways in which we humans interact with information, and generating enormous volumes of electronic data along the way. As a result of these forces, what will data management technologies, and their supporting software and system architectures, look like in ten years? It is difficult to say, but we can see the future taking shape now in a new generation of information access platforms that combine strategies and structures of two familiar -- and previously quite distinct -- technologies, search engines and databases, and in a new model for software applications, the Search-Based Application (SBA), which offers a pragmatic way to solve both well-known and emerging information management challenges as of now. Search engines are the world's most familiar and widely deployed information access tool, used by hundreds of millions of people every day to locate information on the Web, but few are aware they can now also be used to provide precise, multidimensional information access and analysis that is hard to distinguish from current database applications, yet endowed with the usability and massive scalability of Web search. In this book, we hope to introduce Search Based Applications to a wider audience, using real case studies to show how this flexible technology can be used to intelligently aggregate large volumes of unstructured data (like Web pages) and structured data (like database content), and to make that data available in a highly contextual, quasi real-time manner to a wide base of users for a varied range of purposes. We also hope to shed light on the general convergences underway in search and database disciplines, convergences that make SBAs possible, and which serve as harbingers of information management paradigms and technologies to come.

  abstract = {Interpretations of TF-IDF are based on binary independence retrieval, Poisson, information theory, and language modelling. This paper contributes a review of existing interpretations, and then, TF-IDF is systematically related to the probabilities P(q|d) and P(d|q). Two approaches are explored: a space of independent, and a space of disjoint terms. For independent terms, an "extreme" query/non-query term assumption uncovers TF-IDF, and an analogy of P(d|q) and the probabilistic odds O(r|d, q) mirrors relevance feedback. For disjoint terms, a relationship between probability theory and TF-IDF is established through the integral + 1/x dx = log x. This study uncovers components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence (DQI) measure, and interestingly, an integral of the DQI over the term occurrence probability leads to TF-IDF.},

@article{liu2017creating,
  abstract = {This book is the first technical overview of autonomous vehicles written for a general computing and engineering audience. The authors share their practical experiences of creating autonomous vehicle systems. These systems are complex, consisting of three major subsystems: (1) algorithms for localization, perception, and planning and control; (2) client systems, such as the robotics operating system and hardware platform; and (3) the cloud platform, which includes data storage, simulation, high-definition (HD) mapping, and deep learning model training. The algorithm subsystem extracts meaningful information from sensor raw data to understand its environment and make decisions about its actions. The client subsystem integrates these algorithms to meet real-time and reliability requirements. The cloud platform provides offline computing and storage capabilities for autonomous vehicles. Using the cloud platform, we are able to test new algorithms and update the HD map‚Äîplus, train better recognition, tracking, and decision models.

This book consists of nine chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of autonomous vehicle systems; Chapter 2 focuses on localization technologies; Chapter 3 discusses traditional techniques used for perception; Chapter 4 discusses deep learning based techniques for perception; Chapter 5 introduces the planning and control sub-system, especially prediction and routing technologies; Chapter 6 focuses on motion planning and feedback control of the planning and control subsystem; Chapter 7 introduces reinforcement learning-based planning and control; Chapter 8 delves into the details of client systems design; and Chapter 9 provides the details of cloud platforms for autonomous driving.

This book should be useful to students, researchers, and practitioners alike. Whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student interested in autonomous driving, you will find herein a comprehensive overview of the whole autonomous vehicle technology stack. If you are an autonomous driving practitioner, the many practical techniques introduced in this book will be of interest to you. Researchers will also find plenty of references for an effective, deeper exploration of the various technologies.

@article{wu2008interpreting,
  abstract = {A novel probabilistic retrieval model is presented. It forms a basis to interpret the TF-IDF term weights as making relevance decisions. It simulates the local relevance decision-making for every location of a document, and combines all of these ‚Äúlocal‚Äù relevance decisions as the ``document-wide'' relevance decision for the document. The significance of interpreting TF-IDF in this way is the potential to: (1) establish a unifying perspective about information retrieval as relevance decision-making; and (2) develop advanced TF-IDF-related term weights for future elaborate retrieval models. Our novel retrieval model is simplified to a basic ranking formula that directly corresponds to the TF-IDF term weights. In general, we show that the term-frequency factor of the ranking formula can be rendered into different term-frequency factors of existing retrieval systems. In the basic ranking formula, the remaining quantity - $\log p(\bar{r} \, \mid \, t \in d)$ is interpreted as the probability of randomly picking a nonrelevant usage (denoted by $\bar{r}$) of term $t$. Mathematically, we show that this quantity can be approximated by the inverse document-frequency (IDF). Empirically, we show that this quantity is related to IDF, using four reference TREC ad hoc retrieval data collections.},

@article{carmel2010estimating,
  abstract = {Many information retrieval (IR) systems suffer from a radical variance in performance when responding to users' queries. Even for systems that succeed very well on average, the quality of results returned for some of the queries is poor. Thus, it is desirable that IR systems will be able to identify "difficult" queries so they can be handled properly. Understanding why some queries are inherently more difficult than others is essential for IR, and a good answer to this important question will help search engines to reduce the variance in performance, hence better servicing their customer needs. Estimating the query difficulty is an attempt to quantify the quality of search results retrieved for a query from a given collection of documents. This book discusses the reasons that cause search engines to fail for some of the queries, and then reviews recent approaches for estimating query difficulty in the IR field. It then describes a common methodology for evaluating the prediction quality of those estimators, and experiments with some of the predictors applied by various IR methods over several TREC benchmarks. Finally, it discusses potential applications that can utilize query difficulty estimators by handling each query individually and selectively, based upon its estimated difficulty.

  abstract = {Research on social networks has exploded over the last decade. To a large extent, this has been fueled by the spectacular growth of social media and online social networking sites, which continue growing at a very fast pace, as well as by the increasing availability of very large social network datasets for purposes of research. A rich body of this research has been devoted to the analysis of the propagation of information, influence, innovations, infections, practices and customs through networks. Can we build models to explain the way these propagations occur? How can we validate our models against any available real datasets consisting of a social network and propagation traces that occurred in the past? These are just some questions studied by researchers in this area. Information propagation models find applications in viral marketing, outbreak detection, finding key blog posts to read in order to catch important stories, finding leaders or trendsetters, information feed ranking, etc. A number of algorithmic problems arising in these applications have been abstracted and studied extensively by researchers under the garb of influence maximization.

This book starts with a detailed description of well-established diffusion models, including the independent cascade model and the linear threshold model, that have been successful at explaining propagation phenomena. We describe their properties as well as numerous extensions to them, introducing aspects such as competition, budget, and time-criticality, among many others. We delve deep into the key problem of influence maximization, which selects key individuals to activate in order to influence a large fraction of a network. Influence maximization in classic diffusion models including both the independent cascade and the linear threshold models is computationally intractable, more precisely NP-hard, and we describe several approximation algorithms and scalable heuristics that have been proposed in the literature. Finally, we also deal with key issues that need to be tackled in order to turn this research into practice, such as learning the strength with which individuals in a network influence each other, as well as the practical aspects of this research including the availability of datasets and software tools for facilitating research. We conclude with a discussion of various research problems that remain open, both from a technical perspective and from the viewpoint of transferring the results of research into industry strength applications.

  abstract = {In the procedure of Web search, a user first comes up with an information need and a query is issued with the need as guidance. After that, some URLs are clicked and other queries may be issued if those URLs do not meet his need well. We advocate that Web search is governed by a unified hidden space, and each involved element such as query and URL has its inborn position, i.e., projected as a vector, in this space. Each of above actions in the search procedure, i.e. issuing queries or clicking URLs, is an interaction result of those elements in the space. In this paper, we aim at uncovering such a unified hidden space of Web search that uniformly captures the hidden semantics of search queries, URLs and other involved elements in Web search. We learn the semantic space with search session data, because a search session can be regarded as an instantiation of users‚Äô information need on a particular semantic topic and it keeps the interaction information of queries and URLs. We use a set of session graphs to represent search sessions, and the space learning task is cast as a vector learning problem for the graph vertices by maximizing the log-likelihood of a training session data set. Specifically, we developed the well-known Word2vec to perform the learning procedure.

  abstract = {Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informational retrieval refrain from taking positional information into account, due to the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters. Nonetheless, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function can be seen as an embryonic attempt in that direction. In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of virtual region: a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a (larger or smaller, depending on a tunable weighting parameter) evidence of relevance of the document; differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable (usually, but not necessarily, positional-aware) operators to the query. This technique fits nicely in the eliteness model behind BM25 and provides a principled explanation to BM25F; it specializes to BM25(F) for some trivial operators, but has a much more general appeal. Our experiments (both on standard collections, such as TREC, and on Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is beneficial for retrieval effectiveness.},

  abstract = {With its theme, "Our Information, Always and Forever," Part I of this book covers the basics of personal information management (PIM) including six essential activities of PIM and six (different) ways in which information can be personal to us. Part I then goes on to explore key issues that arise in the "great migration" of our information onto the Web and into a myriad of mobile devices.

Part II provides a more focused look at technologies for managing information that promise to profoundly alter our practices of PIM and, through these practices, the way we lead our lives.

Part II is in five chapters:

- Chapter 5. Technologies of Input and Output. Technologies in support of gesture, touch, voice, and even eye movements combine to support a more natural user interface (NUI). Technologies of output include glasses and "watch" watches. Output will also increasingly be animated with options to "zoom".

- Chapter 6. Technologies to Save Our Information. We can opt for "life logs" to record our experiences with increasing fidelity. What will we use these logs for? And what isn‚Äôt recorded that should be?

- Chapter 7. Technologies to Search Our Information. The potential for personalized search is enormous and mostly yet to be realized. Persistent searches, situated in our information landscape, will allow us to maintain a diversity of projects and areas of interest without a need to continually switch from one to another to handle incoming information.

- Chapter 8. Technologies to Structure Our Information. Structure is key if we are to keep, find, and make effective use of our information. But how best to structure? And how best to share structured information between the applications we use, with other people, and also with ourselves over time? What lessons can we draw from the failures and successes in web-based efforts to share structure?

- Chapter 9. PIM Transformed and Transforming: Stories from the Past, Present and Future. Part II concludes with a comparison between Licklider‚Äôs world of information in 1957 and our own world of information today. And then we consider what the world of information is likely to look like in 2057. Licklider estimated that he spent 85% of his "thinking time" in activities that were clerical and mechanical and might (someday) be delegated to the computer. What percentage of our own time is spent with the clerical and mechanical? What about in 2057?

  abstract = {Learning to rank refers to machine learning techniques for training a model in a ranking task. Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on its problems recently, and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, major approaches, theories, applications, and future work.

The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings.

Ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting based, and Neural Network based approaches.

The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include: PRank, OC SVM, McRank, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, LambdaRank, LambdaMART, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking.

The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, collaborative filtering, definition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation.

A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed.

  abstract = {Data is getting bigger and more complex by the day, and so are your choices in handling it. Explore some of the most cutting-edge databases available - from traditional relational databases to newer NoSQL approaches - and make informed decisions about challenging data storage problems. This is the only comprehensive guide to the world of NoSQL databases, with in-depth practical and conceptual introductions to seven different technologies: Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Postgres, and DynamoDB. This second edition includes a new chapter on DynamoDB and updated content for each chapter.

While relational databases such as MySQL remain as relevant as ever, the alternative, NoSQL paradigm has opened up new horizons in performance and scalability and changed the way we approach data-centric problems. This book presents the essential concepts behind each database alongside hands-on examples that make each technology come alive.

With each database, tackle a real-world problem that highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. Along the way, explore five database models - relational, key/value, columnar, document, and graph - from the perspective of challenges faced by real applications. Learn how MongoDB and CouchDB are strikingly different, make your applications faster with Redis and more connected with Neo4J, build a cluster of HBase servers using cloud services such as Amazon's Elastic MapReduce, and more. This new edition brings a brand new chapter on DynamoDB, updated code samples and exercises, and a more up-to-date account of each database's feature set.

Whether you're a programmer building the next big thing, a data scientist seeking solutions to thorny problems, or a technology enthusiast venturing into new territory, you will find something to inspire you in this book.

What You Need:

You'll need a *nix shell (Mac OS or Linux preferred, Windows users will need Cygwin), Java 6 (or greater), and Ruby 1.8.7 (or greater). Each chapter will list the downloads required for that database.},

  abstract = {Understanding distributed computing is not an easy task. This is due to the many facets of uncertainty one has to cope with and master in order to produce correct distributed software. Considering the uncertainty created by asynchrony and process crash failures in the context of message-passing systems, the book focuses on the main abstractions that one has to understand and master in order to be able to produce software with guaranteed properties. These fundamental abstractions are communication abstractions that allow the processes to communicate consistently (namely the register abstraction and the reliable broadcast abstraction), and the consensus agreement abstractions that allows them to cooperate despite failures. As they give a precise meaning to the words "communicate" and "agree" despite asynchrony and failures, these abstractions allow distributed programs to be designed with properties that can be stated and proved.

Impossibility results are associated with these abstractions. Hence, in order to circumvent these impossibilities, the book relies on the failure detector approach, and, consequently, that approach to fault-tolerance is central to the book.

  abstract = {A better understanding of what motivates humans to perform certain actions is relevant for a range of research challenges including generating action sequences that implement goals (planning). A first step in this direction is the task of acquiring knowledge about human goals. In this work, we investigate whether Search Query Logs are a viable source for extracting expressions of human goals. For this purpose, we devise an algorithm that automatically identifies queries containing explicit goals such as find home to rent in Florida. Evaluation results of our algorithm achieve useful precision/recall values. We apply the classification algorithm to two large Search Query Logs, recorded by AOL and Microsoft Research in 2006, and obtain a set of ‚àº110,000 queries containing explicit goals. To study the nature of human goals in Search Query Logs, we conduct qualitative, quantitative and comparative analyses. Our findings suggest that Search Query Logs (i) represent a viable source for extracting human goals, (ii) contain a great variety of human goals and (iii) contain human goals that can be employed to complement existing commonsense knowledge bases. Finally, we illustrate the potential of goal knowledge for addressing following application scenario: to refine and extend commonsense knowledge with human goals from Search Query Logs. This work is relevant for (i) knowledge engineers interested in acquiring human goals from textual corpora and constructing knowledge bases of human goals (ii) researchers interested in studying characteristics of human goals in Search Query Logs.},

  abstract = {Bug localization refers to the automated process of locating the potential buggy files for a given bug report. To help developers focus their attention to those files is crucial. Several existing automated approaches for bug localization from a bug report face a key challenge, called lexical mismatch, in which the terms used in bug reports to describe a bug are different from the terms and code tokens used in source files. This paper presents a novel approach that uses deep neural network (DNN) in combination with rVSM, an information retrieval (IR) technique. rVSM collects the feature on the textual similarity between bug reports and source files. DNN is used to learn to relate the terms in bug reports to potentially different code tokens and terms in source files and documentation if they appear frequently enough in the pairs of reports and buggy files. Our empirical evaluation on real-world projects shows that DNN and IR complement well to each other to achieve higher bug localization accuracy than individual models. Importantly, our new model, HyLoc, with a combination of the features built from DNN, rVSM, and project's bug-fixing history, achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art IR and machine learning techniques. In half of the cases, it is correct with just a single suggested file. Two out of three cases, a correct buggy file is in the list of three suggested files.},

Most developers aren't SQL experts, and most of the SQL that gets used is inefficient, hard to maintain, and sometimes just plain wrong. This book shows you all the common mistakes, and then leads you through the best fixes. What's more, it shows you what's behind these fixes, so you'll learn a lot about relational databases along the way.

Each chapter in this book helps you identify, explain, and correct a unique and dangerous antipattern. The four parts of the book group the anti‚Äãpatterns in terms of logical database design, physical database design, queries, and application development.

The chances are good that your application's database layer already contains problems such as Index Shotgun, Keyless Entry, Fear of the Unknown, and Spaghetti Query. This book will help you and your team find them. Even better, it will also show you how to fix them, and how to avoid these and other problems in the future.

SQL Antipatterns gives you a rare glimpse into an SQL expert's playbook. Now you can stamp out these common database errors once and for all.

Whatever platform or programming language you use, whether you're a junior programmer or a Ph.D., SQL Antipatterns will show you how to design and build databases, how to write better database queries, and how to integrate SQL programming with your application like an expert. You'll also learn the best and most current technology for full-text search, how to design code that is resistant to SQL injection attacks, and other techniques for success.},

Drawing on interviews with Reuters personnel and access to Reuters documentation, we describe the coding policy and quality control procedures used in producing the RCV1 data, the intended semantics of the hierarchical category taxonomies, and the corrections necessary to remove errorful data. We refer to the original data as RCV1-v1, and the corrected data as RCV1-v2. We benchmark several widely used supervised learning methods on RCV1-v2, illustrating the collection's properties, suggesting new directions for research, and providing baseline results for future studies.

  abstract = {Empirical studies of information retrieval methods show that good retrieval performance is closely related to the use of various retrieval heuristics, such as TF-IDF weighting. One basic research question is thus what exactly are these "necessary" heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval performance. In this paper, we present a formal study of retrieval heuristics. We formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval function should satisfy, and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions. We find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally. Empirical results show that when a constraint is not satisfied, it often indicates non-optimality of the method, and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter values, its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range. In general, we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints. Thus the proposed constraints provide a good explanation of many empirical observations and make it possible to evaluate any existing or new retrieval formula analytically.},

Traditionally these are extracted using a large set of patterns; however, this approach is brittle on out-of-domain text and long-range dependencies, and gives no insight into the substructure of the arguments. We replace this large pattern set with a few patterns for canonically structured sentences, and shift the focus to a classifier which learns to extract self-contained clauses from longer sentences. We then run natural logic inference over these short clauses to determine the maximally specific arguments for each candidate triple.

  abstract = { Abstract The time-worn aphorism "close only counts in horseshoes and hand-grenades" is clearly inadequate. Close also counts in golf, shuffleboard, archery, darts, curling, and other games of accuracy in which hitting the precise center of the target isn't to be expected every time, or in which we can expect to be driven from the target by skilled opponents. This lecture is not devoted to sports discussions, but to efficient algorithms for determining pairs of closely related web pages -- and a few other situations in which we have found that inexact matching is good enough; where proximity suffices. We will not, however, attempt to be comprehensive in the investigation of probabilistic algorithms, approximation algorithms, or even techniques for organizing the discovery of nearest neighbors. We are more concerned with finding nearby neighbors; if they are not particularly close by, we are not particularly interested. In thinking of when approximation is sufficient, remember the oft-told joke about two campers sitting around after dinner. They hear noises coming towards them. One of them reaches for a pair of running shoes, and starts to don them. The second then notes that even with running shoes, they cannot hope to outrun a bear, to which the first notes that most likely the bear will be satiated after catching the slower of them. We seek problems in which we don't need to be faster than the bear, just faster than the others fleeing the bear.

Critical Acclaim for On the Efficient Determination of Most Near Neighbors "The material in this book grew from a simple question: "We know how to easily determine whether two files are identical, but what do we know about determining whether two files are similar?" The answer was "Not much," but when a theorist gives this answer, good things often happen. Such was the case here. This book will be important to practitioners interested in this and similar questions. It contains two intertwined threads; a mathematical treatment of the problem and an engineering thread that provides extremely efficient code for obtaining the solution at scale. I recommend it highly." -- Charles P. (Chuck) Thacker, Microsoft Research, 2009 Turing Award Winner

"From de-duplication to search, billion dollar industries rely on the ability to search for keys that are "close" to a specified key. The book by Mark Manasse provides a beautiful exposition of the field. Manasse is a well-known expert who has written some of the fundamental theoretical papers in the field; better still, he has worked on real products such as AltaVista and Windows file de-duplication. Mark has the rare ability to take theoretical ideas and convert them to sound engineering. The book will appeal to developers working in the web milieu because it illuminates the details that are often missing using code snippets. It will also appeal to researchers and students because of the uniform and insightful exposition of an important area." -- George Varghese, Professor, University of California, San Diego

"Mark Manasse, the father of micropayments, provides insight, techniques and theory behind search -- on getting not too large, not too small, but just right results. This 'horseshoes' mini-treatise comes right from the horse's mouth as an AltaVista -- he shows how the game was constructed by high dimensionality mapping into tractable space and time to find ringers and good outliers." -- Gordon Bell, Microsoft Research

  abstract = {We are well into a second age of digital information. Our information is moving from the desktop to the laptop to the "palmtop" and up into an amorphous cloud on the Web. How can one manage both the challenges and opportunities of this new world of digital information? What does the future hold? This book provides an important update on the rapidly expanding field of personal information management (PIM). Part I (Always and Forever) introduces the essentials of PIM. Information is personal for many reasons. It's the information on our hard drives we couldn't bear to lose. It's the information about us that we don't want to share. It's the distracting information demanding our attention even as we try to do something else. It's the information we don't know about but need to. Through PIM, we control personal information. We integrate information into our lives in useful ways. We make it "ours." With basics established, Part I proceeds to explore a critical interplay between personal information "always" at hand through mobile devices and "forever" on the Web. How does information stay "ours" in such a world?

Part II (Building Places of Our Own for Digital Information) will be available in the Summer of 2012, and will consist of the following chapters:

Chapter 5. Technologies to eliminate PIM?: We have seen astonishing advances in the technologies of information management -- in particular, to aid in the storing, structuring and searching of information. These technologies will certainly change the way we do PIM; will they eliminate the need for PIM altogether?

Chapter 6. GIM and the social fabric of PIM: We don't (and shouldn't) manage our information in isolation. Group information management (GIM) -- especially the kind practiced more informally in households and smaller project teams -- goes hand in glove with good PIM.

Chapter 7. PIM by design: Methodologies, principles, questions and considerations as we seek to understand PIM better and to build PIM into our tools, techniques and training.

Chapter 8. To each of us, our own.: Just as we must each be a student of our own practice of PIM, we must also be a designer of this practice. This concluding chapter looks at tips, traps and tradeoffs as we work to build a practice of PIM and "places" of our own for personal information.

It introduces search and content analytics to software buyers, knowledge managers, and searchers who want to understand and design effective online environments. The book describes how search evolved from an expert-only to an end user tool. It provides an overview of search engines, categorization and clustering, natural language processing, content analytics, and visualization technologies. Detailed profiles for Web search, eCommerce search, eDiscovery, and enterprise search contrast the types of users, uses, tasks, technologies, and interaction designs for each. These variables shape each application, although the underlying technologies are the same. Types of information tasks and the trade-offs between precision and recall, time, volume and precision, and privacy vs. personalization are discussed within this context. The book examines trends toward convenient, context-aware computing, big data and analytics technologies, conversational systems, and answer machines. The Answer Machine explores IBM Watson's DeepQA technology and describes how it is used to answer health care and Jeopardy questions. The book concludes by discussing the implications of these advances: how they will change the way we run our businesses, practice medicine, govern, or conduct our lives in the digital age.

  abstract = {Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management. A database system typically aims to support the creation, maintenance, and use of large amount of data, focusing on the quantity of data. However, real-life data are often dirty: inconsistent, duplicated, inaccurate, incomplete, or stale. Dirty data in a database routinely generate misleading or biased analytical results and decisions, and lead to loss of revenues, credibility and customers. With this comes the need for data quality management. In contrast to traditional data management tasks, data quality management enables the detection and correction of errors in the data, syntactic or semantic, in order to improve the quality of the data and hence, add value to business processes. While data quality has been a longstanding problem for decades, the prevalent use of the Web has increased the risks, on an unprecedented scale, of creating and propagating dirty data. This monograph gives an overview of fundamental issues underlying central aspects of data quality, namely, data consistency, data deduplication, data accuracy, data currency, and information completeness. We promote a uniform logical framework for dealing with these issues, based on data quality rules.

The text is organized into seven chapters, focusing on relational data. Chapter One introduces data quality issues. A conditional dependency theory is developed in Chapter Two, for capturing data inconsistencies. It is followed by practical techniques in Chapter 2b for discovering conditional dependencies, and for detecting inconsistencies and repairing data based on conditional dependencies. Matching dependencies are introduced in Chapter Three, as matching rules for data deduplication. A theory of relative information completeness is studied in Chapter Four, revising the classical Closed World Assumption and the Open World Assumption, to characterize incomplete information in the real world. A data currency model is presented in Chapter Five, to identify the current values of entities in a database and to answer queries with the current values, in the absence of reliable timestamps. Finally, interactions between these data quality issues are explored in Chapter Six. Important theoretical results and practical algorithms are covered, but formal proofs are omitted. The bibliographical notes contain pointers to papers in which the results were presented and proven, as well as references to materials for further reading.

This text is intended for a seminar course at the graduate level. It is also to serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in the study of data quality. The fundamental research on data quality draws on several areas, including mathematical logic, computational complexity and database theory. It has raised as many questions as it has answered, and is a rich source of questions and vitality.

It provides an overview of the automated approaches that have been developed to identify and correct these and other classes of learner errors in a number of languages.

Error annotation and system evaluation are particularly important topics in grammatical error detection because there are no commonly accepted standards. Chapters in the book describe the options available to researchers, recommend best practices for reporting results, and present annotation and evaluation schemes.

The final chapters explore recent innovative work that opens new directions for research. It is the authors' hope that this volume will continue to contribute to the growing interest in grammatical error detection by encouraging researchers to take a closer look at the field and its many challenging problems.

  abstract = {News content analysis is usually preceded by a labour-intensive coding phase, where experts extract key information from news items. The cost of this phase imposes limitations on the sample sizes that can be processed, and therefore to the kind of questions that can be addressed. In this paper we describe an approach that incorporates text-analysis technologies for the automation of some of these tasks, enabling us to analyse data sets that are many orders of magnitude larger than those normally used. The patterns detected by our method include: (1) similarities in writing style among several outlets, which reflect reader demographics; (2) gender imbalance in media content and its relation with topic; (3) the relationship between topic and popularity of articles.},

  abstract = {Some models of textual corpora employ text generation methods involving n-gram statistics, while others use latent topic variables inferred using the ``bag-of-words'' assumption, in which word order is ignored. Previously, these methods have not been combined. In this work, I explore a hierarchical generative probabilistic model that incorporates both n-gram statistics and latent topic variables by extending a unigram topic model to include properties of a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model. The model hyperparameters are inferred using a Gibbs EM algorithm. On two data sets, each of 150 documents, the new model exhibits better predictive accuracy than either a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model or a unigram topic model. Additionally, the inferred topics are less dominated by function words than are topics discovered using unigram statistics, potentially making them more meaningful.},

Sophisticated management, load balancing and recovery techniques are needed to achieve high performance and availability amidst an abundance of failure sources that include software, hardware, network connectivity, and power issues. While there is a relative wealth of failure studies of individual components of storage systems, such as disk drives, relatively little has been reported so far on the overall availability behavior of large cloud-based storage services. We characterize the availability properties of cloud storage systems based on an extensive one year study of Google's main storage infrastructure and present statistical models that enable further insight into the impact of multiple design choices, such as data placement and replication strategies. With these models we compare data availability under a variety of system parameters given the real patterns of failures observed in our fleet.},

  abstract = {Information Retrieval has become a very active research field in the 21st century. Many from academia and industry present their innovations in the field in a wide variety of conferences and journals. Companies transfer this new knowledge directly to the general public via services such as web search engines in order to improve their information seeking experience.

In parallel, teaching IR is turning into an important aspect of IR generally, not only because it is necessary to impart effective search techniques to make the most of the IR tools available, but also because we must provide a good foundation for those students who will become the driving force of future IR technologies.

There are very few resources for teaching and learning in IR, the major problem which this book is designed to solve. The objective is to provide ideas and practical experience of teaching and learning IR, for those whose job requires them to teach in one form or another, and where delivering IR courses is a major part of their working lives.

In this context of providing a higher profile for teaching and  learning as applied to IR, the co-editor of this book, Efthimis Efthimiathis, had maintained a leading role in teaching and learning within the domain of IR for a number of years. This book represents a posthumous example of his efforts in the area, as he passed away in April 2011. This book, his book, is dedicated to his memory.},

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an "always-on" experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.},

All of the interesting systems (e.g. transportation, healthcare, power generation) are inherently and unavoidably hazardous by the own nature. The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and irreducibly hazardous. It is the presence of these hazards that drives the creation of defenses against hazard that characterize these systems. 2) Complex systems are heavily and successfully defended against failure. The high consequences of failure lead over time to the construction of multiple layers of defense against failure. These defenses include obvious technical components (e.g. backup systems, 'safety' features of equipment) and human components (e.g. training, knowledge) but also a variety of organizational, institutional, and regulatory defenses (e.g. policies and procedures, certification, work rules, team training). The effect of these measures is to provide a series of shields that normally divert operations away from accidents. 3) Catastrophe requires multiple failures ‚Äì single point failures are not enough..},

Engaging with contemporary concerns about correctness, Horobin considers whether such changes are improvements, or evidence of slipping standards. What is the future for the English language? Will Standard English continue to hold sway, or we are witnessing its replacement by newly emerging Englishes?

@article{lansdallwelfare2017content,
  abstract = {The use of large datasets has revolutionized the natural sciences and is widely believed to have the potential to do so with the social and human sciences. Many digitization efforts are underway, but the high-throughput methods of data production have not yet led to a comparable output in analysis. A notable exception has been the previous statistical analysis of the content of historical books, which started a debate about the limitations of using big data in this context. This study moves the debate forward using a large corpus of historical British newspapers and tools from artificial intelligence to extract macroscopic trends in history and culture, including gender bias, geographical focus, technology, and politics, along with accurate dates for specific events.Previous studies have shown that it is possible to detect macroscopic patterns of cultural change over periods of centuries by analyzing large textual time series, specifically digitized books. This method promises to empower scholars with a quantitative and data-driven tool to study culture and society, but its power has been limited by the use of data from books and simple analytics based essentially on word counts. This study addresses these problems by assembling a vast corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom, incorporating very fine-grained geographical and temporal information that is not available for books. The corpus spans 150 years and is formed by millions of articles, representing 14\% of all British regional outlets of the period. Simple content analysis of this corpus allowed us to detect specific events, like wars, epidemics, coronations, or conclaves, with high accuracy, whereas the use of more refined techniques from artificial intelligence enabled us to move beyond counting words by detecting references to named entities. These techniques allowed us to observe both a systematic underrepresentation and a steady increase of women in the news during the 20th century and the change of geographic focus for various concepts. We also estimate the dates when electricity overtook steam and trains overtook horses as a means of transportation, both around the year 1900, along with observing other cultural transitions. We believe that these data-driven approaches can complement the traditional method of close reading in detecting trends of continuity and change in historical corpora.},

  abstract = {Espresso is a document-oriented distributed data serving platform that has been built to address LinkedIn's requirements for a scalable, performant, source-of-truth primary store. It provides a hierarchical document model, transactional support for modifications to related documents, real-time secondary indexing, on-the-fly schema evolution and provides a timeline consistent change capture stream. This paper describes the motivation and design principles involved in building Espresso, the data model and capabilities exposed to clients, details of the replication and secondary indexing implementation and presents a set of experimental results that characterize the performance of the system along various dimensions. When we set out to build Espresso, we chose to apply best practices in industry, already published works in research and our own internal experience with different consistency models. Along the way, we built a novel generic distributed cluster management framework, a partition-aware change- capture pipeline and a high-performance inverted index implementation.},

Kepler provides a simple way of designing and executing complex workflows in the form of directed graphs. This work presents a scalable approach to convert published research as PDF documents into indexable XML documents using Kepler.

Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments.

Linearizability is a correctness condition for concurrent objects that exploits the semantics of abstract data types. It permits a high degree of concurrency, yet it permits programmers to specify and reason about concurrent objects using known techniques from the sequential domain. Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response, implying that the meaning of a concurrent object's operations can be given by pre- and post-conditions. This paper defines linearizability, compares it to other correctness conditions, presents and demonstrates a method for proving the correctness of implementations, and shows how to reason about concurrent objects, given they are linearizable.},

In this paper we present an algorithm and formal semantics for a JSON data structure that automatically resolves concurrent modifications such that no updates are lost, and such that all replicas converge towards the same state (a conflict-free replicated datatype or CRDT). It supports arbitrarily nested list and map types, which can be modified by insertion, deletion and assignment. The algorithm performs all merging client-side and does not depend on ordering guarantees from the network, making it suitable for deployment on mobile devices with poor network connectivity, in peer-to-peer networks, and in messaging systems with end-to-end encryption.},

The need to convert this raw data into useful information has spawned considerable innovation in systems for large-scale data analytics, especially over the last decade. Massively Parallel Databases and MapReduce Systems addresses the design principles and core features of systems for analyzing very large datasets using massively-parallel computation and storage techniques on large clusters of nodes. It first discusses how the requirements of data analytics have evolved since the early work on parallel database systems. It then describes some of the major technological innovations that have each spawned a distinct category of systems for data analytics. Each unique system category is described along a number of dimensions including data model and query interface, storage layer, execution engine, query optimization, scheduling, resource management, and fault tolerance. It concludes with a summary of present trends in large-scale data analytics.

  abstract = {We describe a family of caching protocols for distrib-uted networks that can be used to decrease or eliminate the occurrence of hot spots in the network. Our protocols are particularly designed for use with very large networks such as the Internet, where delays caused by hot spots can be severe, and where it is not feasible for every server to have complete information about the current state of the entire network. The protocols are easy to implement using existing network protocols such as TCP/IP, and require very little overhead. The protocols work with local control, make efficient use of existing resources, and scale gracefully as the network grows. Our caching protocols are based on a special kind of hashing that we call consistent hashing. Roughly speaking, a consistent hash function is one which changes minimally as the range of the function changes. Through the development of good consistent hash functions, we are able to develop caching protocols which do not require users to have a current or even consistent view of the network. We believe that consistent hash functions may eventually prove to be useful in other applications such as distributed name servers and/or quorum systems.},

  abstract = {Distributed consensus is integral to modern distributed systems. The widely adopted Paxos algorithm uses two phases, each requiring majority agreement, to reliably reach consensus. In this paper, we demonstrate that Paxos, which lies at the foundation of many production systems, is conservative. Specifically, we observe that each of the phases of Paxos may use non-intersecting quorums. Majority quorums are not necessary as intersection is required only across phases. Using this weakening of the requirements made in the original formulation, we propose Flexible Paxos, which generalizes over the Paxos algorithm to provide flexible quorums. We show that Flexible Paxos is safe, efficient and easy to utilize in existing distributed systems. We discuss far reaching implications of this result. For example, improved availability results from reducing the size of second phase quorums by one when the system size is even, while keeping majority quorums in the first phase. Another example is improved throughput of replication by using much smaller phase 2 quorums, while increasing the leader election (phase 1) quorums. Finally, non intersecting quorums in either first or second phases may enhance the efficiency of both.},

  abstract = {The database research community has been building methods to store, access, and update data for more than four decades. Throughout the evolution of the structures and techniques used to access data, access methods adapt to the ever-changing hardware and workload requirements. Today, even small changes in the workload or the hardware lead to a redesign of access methods. The need for new designs has been increasing as data generation and workload diversification grow exponentially, and hardware advances introduce increased complexity. New workload requirements are introduced by the emergence of new applications, and data is managed by large systems composed of more and more complex and heterogeneous hardware. As a result, it is increasingly important to develop application-aware and hardware-aware access methods. The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i) read times (R), ii) update cost (U), and iii) memory (or storage) overhead (M). In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third. We present a simple model of the RUM overheads, and we articulate the RUM Conjecture. We show how the RUM Conjecture manifests in stateof-the-art access methods, and we envision a trend toward RUMaware access methods for future data systems.},

  abstract = {The advent of non-volatile memory (NVM) will fundamentally change the dichotomy between memory and durable storage in database management systems (DBMSs). These new NVM devices are almost as fast as DRAM, but all writes to it are potentially persistent even after power loss. Existing DBMSs are unable to take full advantage of this technology because their internal architectures are predicated on the assumption that memory is volatile. With NVM, many of the components of legacy DBMSs are unnecessary and will degrade the performance of data intensive applications. To better understand these issues, we implemented three engines in a modular DBMS testbed that are based on different storage management architectures: (1) in-place updates, (2) copy-on-write updates, and (3) log-structured updates. We then present NVM-aware variants of these architectures that leverage the persistence and byte-addressability properties of NVM in their storage and recovery methods. Our experimental evaluation on an NVM hardware emulator shows that these engines achieve up to 5.5X higher throughput than their traditional counterparts while reducing the amount of wear due to write operations by up to 2X. We also demonstrate that our NVM-aware recovery protocols allow these engines to recover almost instantaneously after the DBMS restarts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for disk storage management called a log-structured file system. A logstructured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log into segments and use a segment cleaner to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. We present a series of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a prototype logstructured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes while matching or exceeding Unix performance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems typically can use only 5-10%.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos.

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called "Divide-and-Conquer"), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks.

@article{ports2012serializable,
  abstract = {This paper describes our experience implementing PostgreSQL‚Äôs new serializable isolation level. It is based on the recently-developed Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) technique. This is the first implementation of SSI in a production database release as well as the first in a database that did not previously have a lock-based serializable isolation level. We reflect on our experience and describe how we overcame some of the resulting challenges, including the implementation of a new lock manager, a technique for ensuring memory usage is bounded, and integration with other PostgreSQL features. We also introduce an extension to SSI that improves performance for read-only transactions. We evaluate PostgreSQL‚Äôs serializable isolation level using several benchmarks and show that it achieves performance only slightly below that of snapshot isolation, and significantly outperforms the traditional two-phase locking approach on read-intensive workloads.},

@article{mahajan2011consistency,
  abstract = {We examine the limits of consistency in fault-tolerant distributed storage systems. In particular, we identify fundamental tradeoffs among properties of consistency, availability, and convergence, and we close the gap between what is known to be impossible (i.e. CAP) and known systems that are highly-available but that provide weaker consistency such as causal. Specifically, in the asynchronous model with omission-failures and unreliable networks, we show the following tight bound: No consistency stronger than Real Time Causal Consistency (RTC) can be provided in an always-available, one-way convergent system and RTC can be provided in an always-available, one-way convergent system. In the asynchronous, Byzantine-failure model, we show that it is impossible to implement many of the recently introduced fork-based consistency semantics without sacrificing either availability or convergence; notably, proposed systems allow Byzantine nodes to permanently partition correct nodes from one another. To address this limitation, we introduce bounded fork join causal semantics that extends causal consistency to Byzantine environments while retaining availability and convergence.},

  abstract = {The Levenshtein-distance between two words is the minimal number of insertions, deletions or substitutions that are needed to transform one word into the other. Levenshtein-automata of degree n for a word W are dened as nite state automata that regognize the set of all words V where the Levenshtein-distance between V and W does not exceed n. We show how to compute, for any xed bound n and any input word W , a deterministic Levenshtein-automaton of degree n for W in time linear in the length of W . Given an electronic dictionary that is implemented in the form of a trie or a nite state automaton, the Levenshtein-automaton for W can be used to control search in the lexicon in such a way that exactly the lexical words V are generated where the Levenshtein-distance between V and W does not exceed the given bound. This leads to a very fast method for correcting corrupted input words of unrestricted text using large electronic dictionaries. We then introduce a second method that avoids the explicit computation of Levenshtein-automata and leads to even improved eciency. We also describe how to extend both methods to variants of the Levenshtein-distance where further primitive edit operations (transpositions, merges and splits) may be used.

@article{bloom1970spacetime,
  abstract = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.},

@article{debrabant2013anticaching,
  abstract = {The traditional wisdom for building disk-based relational database management systems (DBMS) is to organize data in heavily-encoded blocks stored on disk, with a main memory block cache. In order to improve performance given high disk latency, these systems use a multi-threaded architecture with dynamic record-level locking that allows multiple transactions to access the database at the same time. Previous research has shown that this results in substantial overhead for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) applications [15]. The next generation DBMSs seek to overcome these limitations with architecture based on main memory resident data. To overcome the restriction that all data fit in main memory, we propose a new technique, called anti-caching, where cold data is moved to disk in a transactionally-safe manner as the database grows in size. Because data initially resides in memory, an anti-caching architecture reverses the traditional storage hierarchy of disk-based systems. Main memory is now the primary storage device. We implemented a prototype of our anti-caching proposal in a high-performance, main memory OLTP DBMS and performed a series of experiments across a range of database sizes, workload skews, and read/write mixes. We compared its performance with an open-source, disk-based DBMS optionally fronted by a distributed main memory cache. Our results show that for higher skewed workloads the anti-caching architecture has a performance advantage over either of the other architectures tested of up to 9√ó for a data size 8√ó larger than memory.},

At the weak end of the spectrum of possible consistency models is eventual consistency, which provides no limit to the staleness of data returned. However, anecdotally, eventual consistency is often "good enough" for practitioners given its latency and availability benefits. In this work, we explain this phenomenon and demonstrate that, despite their weak guarantees, eventually consistent systems regularly return consistent data while providing lower latency than their strongly consistent counterparts. To quantify the behavior of eventually consistent stores, we introduce Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS), a consistency model that provides expected bounds on data staleness with respect to both versions and wall clock time. We derive a closed-form solution for version-based staleness and model real-time staleness for a large class of quorum replicated, Dynamo-style stores. Using PBS, we measure the trade-off between latency and consistency for partial, non-overlapping quorum systems under Internet production workloads. We quantitatively demonstrate how and why eventually consistent systems frequently return consistent data within tens of milliseconds while offering large latency benefits.},

@article{oneil1996logstructured,
  abstract = {High-performance transaction system applications typically insert rows in a History table to provide an activity trace; at the same time the transaction system generates log records for purposes of system recovery. Both types of generated information can benefit from efficient indexing. An example in a well-known setting is the TPC-A benchmark application, modified to support efficient queries on the history for account activity for specific accounts. This requires an index by account-id on the fast-growing History table. Unfortunately, standard disk-based index structures such as the B-tree will effectively double the I/O cost of the transaction to maintain an index such as this in real time, increasing the total system cost up to fifty percent. Clearly a method for maintaining a real-time index at low cost is desirable. The log-structured mergetree (LSM-tree) is a disk-based data structure designed to provide low-cost indexing for a file experiencing a high rate of record inserts (and deletes) over an extended period. The LSM-tree uses an algorithm that defers and batches index changes, cascading the changes from a memory-based component through one or more disk components in an efficient manner reminiscent of merge sort. During this process all index values are continuously accessible to retrievals (aside from very short locking periods), either through the memory component or one of the disk components. The algorithm has greatly reduced disk arm movements compared to a traditional access methods such as B-trees, and will improve cost-performance in domains where disk arm costs for inserts with traditional access methods overwhelm storage media costs. The LSM-tree approach also generalizes to operations other than insert and delete. However, indexed finds requiring immediate response will lose I/O efficiency in some cases, so the LSM-tree is most useful in applications where index inserts are more common than finds that retrieve the entries. This seems to be a common property for history tables and log files, for example. The conclusions of Sect. 6 compare the hybrid use of memory and disk components in the LSM-tree access method with the commonly understood advantage of the hybrid method to buffer disk pages in memory.},

@article{evans2012rethinking,
  abstract = {A content-addressable system works by creating a deterministic mapping between unique key and a name-space partition. How these partitions are distributed throughout a cluster of machines is key to a well functioning system.

The most naive approach to a one-hop DHT, uses a single unique token from within the key name-space assigned to each node. The range beginning with the next lowest sorting token and ending in the nodes token, makes up that nodes partition. This single partition per node distribution works, but suffers from a number of problems, not least of which is the small number of localized nodes involved in fail-over and repair, and the operational complexity of expanding the cluster without creating imbalance.

In the paper entitled Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-Value Store, Amazon's solution to partition distribution was to randomly assign many randomly allocated tokens to each machine in the cluster. This approach, referred to as "virtual nodes", permits cluster-wide parallelism during fail-over and repair, and requires no manual intervention in maintaining a high degree of balance.

Despite the inspiration that Dynamo provided for Cassandra, an early design decision eschewed virtual nodes in favor of a simpler implementation. This talk will compare and contrast the differing approaches to distribution, the properties they provide, and will discuss the transition of Cassandra from 1-token-per-node, to a complete virtual nodes implementation.},

The way Cassandra manages the persistent state in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems relying on this service. While in many ways Cassandra resembles a database and shares many design and implementation strategies therewith, Cassandra does not support a full relational data model; instead, it provides clients with a simple data model that supports dynamic control over data layout and format.

  abstract = {In cloud computing environments, a large number of users access data stored in highly available storage systems. To provide good performance to geographically disperse users and allow operation even in the presence of failures or network partitions, these systems often rely on optimistic replication solutions that guarantee only eventual consistency. In this scenario, it is important to be able to accurately and efficiently identify updates executed concurrently. In this paper, first we review, and expose problems with current approaches to causality tracking in optimistic replication: these either lose information about causality or do not scale, as they require replicas to maintain information that grows linearly with the number of clients or updates. Then, we propose a novel solution that fully captures causality while being very concise in that it maintains information that grows linearly only with the number of servers that register updates for a given data element, bounded by the degree of replication.

In this work, we consider the problem of providing Highly Available Transactions (HATs): transactional guarantees that do not suffer unavailability during system partitions or incur high network latency. We introduce a taxonomy of highly available systems and analyze existing ACID isolation and distributed data consistency guarantees to identify which can and cannot be achieved in HAT systems. This unifies the literature on weak transactional isolation, replica consistency, and highly available systems. We analytically and experimentally quantify the availability and performance benefits of HATs‚Äîoften two to three orders of magnitude over wide-area networks‚Äîand discuss their necessary semantic compromises.},

  abstract = {Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases include a suite of features---disk-resident B-trees and heap files, locking-based concurrency control, support for multi-threading---that were optimized for computer technology of the late 1970's. Advances in modern processors, memories, and networks mean that today's computers are vastly different from those of 30 years ago, such that many OLTP databases will now fit in main memory, and most OLTP transactions can be processed in milliseconds or less. Yet database architecture has changed little. Based on this observation, we look at some interesting variants of conventional database systems that one might build that exploit recent hardware trends, and speculate on their performance through a detailed instruction-level breakdown of the major components involved in a transaction processing database system (Shore) running a subset of TPC-C. Rather than simply profiling Shore, we progressively modified it so that after every feature removal or optimization, we had a (faster) working system that fully ran our workload. Overall, we identify overheads and optimizations that explain a total difference of about a factor of 20x in raw performance. We also show that there is no single "high pole in the tent" in modern (memory resident) database systems, but that substantial time is spent in logging, latching, locking, B-tree, and buffer management operations.},

@article{jr1983detection,
  abstract = {Many distributed systems are now being developed to provide users with convenient access to data via some kind of communications network. In many cases it is desirable to keep the system functioning even when it is partitioned by network failures. A serious problem in this context is how one can support redundant copies of resources such as files (for the sake of reliability) while simultaneously monitoring their mutual consistency (the equality of multiple copies). This is difficult since network faiures can lead to inconsistency, and disrupt attempts at maintaining consistency. In fact, even the detection of inconsistent copies is a nontrivial problem. Naive methods either 1) compare the multiple copies entirely or 2) perform simple tests which will diagnose some consistent copies as inconsistent. Here a new approach, involving version vectors and origin points, is presented and shown to detect single file, multiple copy mutual inconsistency effectively. The approach has been used in the design of LOCUS, a local network operating system at UCLA.},

  abstract = {At the foundation of Amazon's cloud computing are infrastructure services such as Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service), SimpleDB, and EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) that provide the resources for constructing Internet-scale computing platforms and a great variety of applications. Under the covers these services are massive distributed systems that operate on a worldwide scale. This scale creates additional challenges, because when a system processes trillions and trillions of requests, events that normally have a low probability of occurrence are now guaranteed to happen and must be accounted for upfront in the design and architecture of the system. When designing these large-scale systems at Amazon, systems designers use a set of guiding principles and abstractions related to large-scale data replication and focus on the trade-offs between high availability and data consistency. This article presents some of the relevant background that has informed the designers' approach to delivering reliable distributed systems that must operate on a global scale.},

@article{adya1999consistency,
  abstract = {Current commercial databases allow application programmers to trade off consistency for performance. However, existing definitions of weak consistency levels are either imprecise or they disallow efficient implementation techniques such as optimism. Ruling out these techniques is especially unfortunate because commercial databases support optimistic mechanisms. Furthermore, optimism is likely to be the implementation technique of choice in the geographically distributed and mobile systems of the future. This thesis presents the first implementation-independent specifications of existing ANSI isolation levels and a number of levels that are widely used in commercial systems, e.g., Cursor Stability, Snapshot Isolation. It also specifies a variety of guarantees for predicate-based operations in an implementation-independent manner. Two new levels are defined that provide useful consistency guarantees to application writers; one is the weakest level that ensures consistent reads, while the other captures some useful consistency properties provided by pessimistic implementations. We use a graph-based approach to define different isolation levels in a simple and intuitive manner. The thesis describes new implementation techniques for supporting different weak consistency levels in distributed client-server environments. The mechanisms are based on optimism and make use of multipart timestamps. A new technique is presented that allows multipart timestamps to scale well with the number of clients and servers in our system; the technique takes advantage of loosely synchronized clocks for removing old information in multipart timestamps. This thesis also presents the results of a simulation study to evaluate the performance of our optimistic schemes in data-shipping client-server systems The results show that the cost of providing serializability relative to mechanisms that provide lower consistency guarantees is negligible for low-contention workloads; furthermore, even for workloads with moderate to high-contention workloads, the cost of serializability is low. The simulation study also shows that our mechanisms based on multipart timestamps impose very low CPU, memory, and network costs while providing strong consistency guarantees to read-only and executing transactions.},

  abstract = {Understanding distributed computing is not an easy task. This is due to the many facets of uncertainty one has to cope with and master in order to produce correct distributed software. Considering the uncertainty created by asynchrony and process crash failures in the context of message-passing systems, the book focuses on the main abstractions that one has to understand and master in order to be able to produce software with guaranteed properties. These fundamental abstractions are communication abstractions that allow the processes to communicate consistently (namely the register abstraction and the reliable broadcast abstraction), and the consensus agreement abstractions that allows them to cooperate despite failures. As they give a precise meaning to the words "communicate" and "agree" despite asynchrony and failures, these abstractions allow distributed programs to be designed with properties that can be stated and proved.

Impossibility results are associated with these abstractions. Hence, in order to circumvent these impossibilities, the book relies on the failure detector approach, and, consequently, that approach to fault-tolerance is central to the book.},

  abstract = {Contemporary storage systems increasingly offer schema flexibility and support for semi-structured data models. This is the case for document-oriented databases, which as such allow ingestion of data from heterogeneous sources (IoT, sensors, monitoring). The increased influx of data further emphasizes the necessity for horizontal and elastic scalability, which are attained in NoSQL document stores through simplifying query functionality and relaxing transactional properties, e.g. through eventual consistency. The most compelling benefits of document stores are attained when data is stored in a denormalized form (De-NF). For example, one can decide to store relationships as an embedded copy to increase read query performance and as such avoid costly cross-node consultations. In comparison to the normalized form (NF), such designs come at a cost of additional data duplication, consistency and decreased write- and update performance. Determining the most appropriate data model for an application however depends on many factors, and the application developer is faced with the complexity of designing document data models that are optimized in terms of performance, scalability, storage and memory size, all requiring in-depth knowledge on the technology, the data meta-model, query plans and expected workloads. In this paper, we first discuss factors that impact the data schema design in document stores, such as the nature of the document and its attributes, horizontal partitioning, index selection, workload variability, and data uniformity. Although some data model design support tools are in existence, there are none that systematically take into account all these factors. Then, we outline our vision and roadmap towards systematic schema design support and tooling that involves (i) leveraging heuristics and common tactics to generate a finite number of candidate data models and (ii) ranking these candidate data models by means of cost functions that express their costeffectiveness.},

SHC leverages optimization techniques of relational data processing over the distributed and column-oriented key-value store (i.e., HBase). Compared to existing systems, SHC makes two major contributions. At first, SHC offers a much tighter integration between optimizations of relational data processing and non-relational data store, through a plug-in implementation that integrates with Spark SQL, a distributed in-memory computing engine for relational data. The design makes the system maintenance relatively easy, and enables users to perform complex data analytics on top of key-value store. Second, SHC leverages the Spark SQL Catalyst engine for high performance query optimizations and processing, e.g., data partitions pruning, columns pruning, predicates pushdown and data locality. SHC has been deployed and used in multiple production environments with hundreds of nodes, and provides OLAP query processing on petabytes of data efficiently.},

Such data models contribute to long-term development complexity, as their lack of explicit entity and relationship tracking burdens new developers unfamiliar with the dataset. Furthermore, the large amount of data repetition present in such data layouts can introduce update anomalies and poor scan performance, which reduce both the quality and performance of analytics over the data.

In this paper we present an algorithm that automatically transforms the denormalized, nested data commonly found in NoSQL systems into traditional relational data that can be stored in a standard RDBMS. This process includes a schema generation algorithm that discovers relationships across the attributes of the denormalized datasets in order to organize those attributes into relational tables. It further includes a matching algorithm that discovers sets of attributes that represent overlapping entities and merges those sets together. These algorithms reduce data repetition, allow the use of data analysis tools targeted at relational data, accelerate scan-intensive algorithms over the data, and help users gain a semantic understanding of complex, nested datasets.},

@book{kranakis2010mobile,
  abstract = {Mobile agent computing is being used in fields as diverse as artificial intelligence, computational economics and robotics. Agents' ability to adapt dynamically and execute asynchronously and autonomously brings potential advantages in terms of fault-tolerance, flexibility and simplicity. This monograph focuses on studying mobile agents as modelled in distributed systems research and in particular within the framework of research performed in the distributed algorithms community. It studies the fundamental question of how to achieve rendezvous, the gathering of two or more agents at the same node of a network. Like leader election, such an operation is a useful subroutine in more general computations that may require the agents to synchronize, share information, divide up chores, etc.

The work provides an introduction to the algorithmic issues raised by the rendezvous problem in the distributed computing setting. For the most part our investigation concentrates on the simplest case of two agents attempting to rendezvous on a ring network. Other situations including multiple agents, faulty nodes and other topologies are also examined. An extensive bibliography provides many pointers to related work not covered in the text.

The presentation has a distinctly algorithmic, rigorous, distributed computing flavor and most results should be easily accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and mathematics departments.},

@inproceedings{flores2017invariant,
  abstract = {Due to the requirements imposed by data-intensive applications, NoSQL and NewSQL databases are becoming more present in the IT Market. These products provide alternative data models to the relational databases, and most of them are intrinsically distributed. These database management systems (DBMSs) relax consistency to favor availability and performance. However, applications that use NoSQL/NewSQL databases in distributed environments have to perform consistency control to avoid anomalies, such as inconsistent data and behavior. New approaches suggest the use of replicated data types (RDTs) to control conflicting updates. Another strategy is the use of different consistencies models for each type of operation, using first-order logic and theorem provers to supply the programmer with tools to classify consistency in operations while maintaining system invariants. Notwithstanding, the use of RDT or the descriptions of application integrity constraints in languages using first-order logic is still difficult to be used by programmers. Aiming to simplify the definition of most common database constraints, this paper proposes a mechanism to extract usual integrity constraints in an intermediate model, taking into account the semantics of invariances, using a mix of RDTs and first-order logic. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the proposed mechanism simplifies and guarantees safer programming with consistency control being performed at the application level.},

@inproceedings{huang2016yinmem,
  abstract = {Machine learning and graph analytics typically process data in an iterative way, reading the same data multiple times and sharing intermediate results across the worker nodes in cluster. Hadoop MapReduce and Spark are two popular open source cluster compute frameworks for large scale data analytics. Apache Spark is currently the state-of-the-art in-memory computation model extending MapReduce by transforming data into RDDs stored in memory. One limitation of Spark, however, lies in the fact that data transformation and distribution is implicitly managed by HDFS. Data locality is not guaranteed for iterative machine learning algorithms which read the same data multiple times. For example, data needed for operations to one worker node might reside in RDDs stored in other worker nodes. The resulting data shuffling becomes a bottleneck when iteratively reading such RDDs. We propose YinMem, a parallel distributed indexed in-memory computation system, bridging the gap between Hadoop ecosystem and HPC by replacing MapReduce with MPI while obtaining the advantage of the distributed data storage. YinMem achieves fair load balancing prior to computation for large sparse matrix by scheduling and distributing indexed data from NoSQL database to the RAM of working nodes. YinMem explores Alluxio as the in-memory storage system and enables efficient data sharing of intermediate results. Preliminary results show that YinMem has achieved 3√ó speedup to Spark, for computing eigenvalue and eigenvectors of a 16-million scale sparse matrix.},

Data-processing systems that aim to ingest, store, index, and analyze Big Data must deal with such geo-tagged data efficiently. In this paper, among representative, disk-resident spatial indexing methods that have been adopted by major SQL and NoSQL systems, we implement five variants of these methods in the form of Log-Structured Merge-tree-based (LSM) spatial indexes in order to evaluate their pros and cons for dynamic geo-tagged Big Data. We have implemented the alternatives, including LSM-based B-tree, R-tree, and inverted index variants, in Apache AsterixDB, an open source Big Data management system. This implementation enabled comparison in terms of real end-to-end performance, including logging and locking overheads, in a full-function, query-based system setting. Our evaluation includes both static and dynamic workloads, ranging from a "load once, query many" case to a case where continuous concurrent incremental inserts are mixed with concurrent queries. Based on the results, we discuss the pros and cons of the five index variants.},

While the ability to adapt to the complexity of a SPARQL query -- given their inherent diversity -- is crucial, current approaches do not scale well when faced with substantially complex, non-selective joins, resulting in exponential growth of execution times. In this demonstration we present H2 RDF+, an RDF store that efficiently performs distributed Merge and Sort-Merge joins using a multiple-index scheme over HBase indexes. Through a greedy planner that incorporates our cost-model, it adaptively commands for either single or multi-machine query execution based on join complexity. In this paper, we present its key scientific contributions and allow participants to interact with an H2RDF+ deployment over a Cloud infrastructure. Using a web-based GUI we allow users to load different datasets (both real and synthetic), apply any query (custom or predefined) and monitor its execution. By allowing real-time inspection of cluster status, response times and committed resources the audience will evaluate the validity of H2RDF+'s claims and perform direct comparisons to two other state-of-the-art RDF stores.},

@book{raynal2010faulttolerant,
  abstract = {Understanding distributed computing is not an easy task. This is due to the many facets of uncertainty one has to cope with and master in order to produce correct distributed software. A previous book Communication and Agreement Abstraction for Fault-tolerant Asynchronous Distributed Systems (published by Morgan & Claypool, 2010) was devoted to the problems created by crash failures in asynchronous message-passing systems.

The present book focuses on the way to cope with the uncertainty created by process failures (crash, omission failures and Byzantine behavior) in synchronous message-passing systems (i.e., systems whose progress is governed by the passage of time). To that end, the book considers fundamental problems that distributed synchronous processes have to solve. These fundamental problems concern agreement among processes (if processes are unable to agree in one way or another in presence of failures, no non-trivial problem can be solved). They are consensus, interactive consistency, k-set agreement and non-blocking atomic commit.

Being able to solve these basic problems efficiently with provable guarantees allows applications designers to give a precise meaning to the words "cooperate" and "agree" despite failures, and write distributed synchronous programs with properties that can be stated and proved.

Hence, the aim of the book is to present a comprehensive view of agreement problems, algorithms that solve them and associated computability bounds in synchronous message-passing distributed systems.},

@inproceedings{sedlar2014learned,
  abstract = {The modern platforms that we want to use to manage our data are far more complex to program efficiently than the machines we used in the past. Every computer we run on is a massively parallel machine with many architectural "surprises" for programmers who are unaware of the way the underlying hardware architecture works. A simple way to think about this is that optimal programs must specify how & where the data should move, not just what computations should be performed and in what order. Architecture-oblivious software that leaves the decisions about data movement to a low-level coherence protocol is becoming much less efficient, relatively speaking. After an extended flirtation with using imperative programming frameworks such as Map-Reduce and NoSQL, many people are returning back to declarative languages like SQL, where the language compiler & runtime are free to make most of the data movement decisions for the programmer. Another way to think about a SQL compiler is that it includes an "algorithm picker" and the runtime includes libraries of useful algorithm implementations (which contain the data movement specifications). This talk will discuss the needs and opportunities for expanding the domain of algorithm-picking languages like SQL. Doing so will require integration with managed-language runtime compilers (e.g. Java or Javascript compilers) that are integrated with the SQL compiler not just to provide efficiency gains during query execution, but also to use managed language runtime profiling to help in algorithm selection as well as assembly-level compilation decisions.},

We propose virtual lightweight snapshots (VLS), a mechanism that enables consistent analytics without blocking incoming updates in NoSQL stores. VLS requires neither native support for database versioning nor a transaction manager. Besides, it is storage-efficient, keeping additional versions of records only when needed to guarantee consistency, and sharing versions across multiple concurrent snapshots.

  abstract = {Financial transactions, internet search, and data analysis are all placing increasing demands on databases. SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases have been developed to meet these demands and each offers unique benefits. SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases also rely on different underlying mathematical models. Polystores seek to provide a mechanism to allow applications to transparently achieve the benefits of diverse databases while insulating applications from the details of these databases. Integrating the underlying mathematics of these diverse databases can be an important enabler for polystores as it enables effective reasoning across different databases. Associative arrays provide a common approach for the mathematics of polystores by encompassing the mathematics found in different databases: sets (SQL), graphs (NoSQL), and matrices (NewSQL). Prior work presented the SQL relational model in terms of associative arrays and identified key mathematical properties that are preserved within SQL. This work provides the rigorous mathematical definitions, lemmas, and theorems underlying these properties. Specifically, SQL Relational Algebra deals primarily with relations - multisets of tuples - and operations on and between those relations. These relations can be modeled as associative arrays by treating tuples as non-zero rows in an array. Operations in relational algebra are built as compositions of standard operations on associative arrays which mirror their matrix counterparts. These constructions provide insight into how relational algebra can be handled via array operations. As an example application, the composition of two projection operations is shown to also be a projection, and the projection of a union is shown to be equal to the union of the projections.},

  abstract = {The key objective of this tutorial is to provide a broad, yet an in-depth survey of the emerging field of co-designing software, hardware, and systems components for accelerating enterprise data management workloads. The overall goal of this tutorial is two-fold. First, we provide a concise system-level characterization of different types of data management technologies, namely, the relational and NoSQL databases and data stream management systems from the perspective of analytical workloads. Using the characterization, we discuss opportunities for accelerating key data management workloads using software and hardware approaches. Second, we dive deeper into the hardware acceleration opportunities using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for the query execution pipeline. Furthermore, we explore other hardware acceleration mechanisms such as single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) that enables short-vector data parallelism.},

  abstract = {Data is increasingly affecting the automotive industry, from vehicle development, to manufacturing and service processes, to online services centered around the connected vehicle. Connected, mobile and Internet of Things devices and machines generate immense amounts of sensor data. The ability to process and analyze this data to extract insights and knowledge that enable intelligent services, new ways to understand business problems, improvements of processes and decisions, is a critical capability. Hadoop is a scalable platform for compute and storage and emerged as de-facto standard for Big Data processing at Internet companies and in the scientific community. However, there is a lack of understanding of how and for what use cases these new Hadoop capabilities can be efficiently used to augment automotive applications and systems. This paper surveys use cases and applications for deploying Hadoop in the automotive industry. Over the years a rich ecosystem emerged around Hadoop comprising tools for parallel, in-memory and stream processing (most notable MapReduce and Spark), SQL and NOSQL engines (Hive, HBase), and machine learning (Mahout, MLlib). It is critical to develop an understanding of automotive applications and their characteristics and requirements for data discovery, integration, exploration and analytics. We then map these requirements to a confined technical architecture consisting of core Hadoop services and libraries for data ingest, processing and analytics. The objective of this paper is to address questions, such as: What applications and datasets are suitable for Hadoop? How can a diverse set of frameworks and tools be managed on multi-tenant Hadoop cluster? How do these tools integrate with existing relational data management systems? How can enterprise security requirements be addressed? What are the performance characteristics of these tools for real-world automotive applications? To address the last question, we utilize a standard benchmark (TPCx-HS), and two application benchmarks (SQL and machine learning) that operate on a dataset of multiple Terabytes and billions of rows.},

  abstract = {Big Data analytics has become an invaluable tool in a wide variety of businesses for exploiting the wealth of Big Data that they now have access to. As a result, various solutions within different categories of Big Data systems are emerging to meet their needs. In this paper we use the TPC-H benchmark to compare the performance of four Big Data systems picked from the major categories of Big Data platforms: a commercial parallel relational database (from the traditional DBMS world), Hive and Spark SQL (from the SQL-on-Hadoop world), and AsterixDB (from the world of NoSQL systems). All of these systems have sufficiently rich query APIs and runtime systems to run TPC-H in its full form. On the other hand, the systems also have major differences in terms of their architectures, preferred storage formats, support for complex schema definitions, and approaches to query processing. This makes them a very interesting set of representative Big Data systems to compare. We present the results that we obtained through running these systems at different TPC-H scales using various settings, and we analyze a selected set of interesting query results in more detail to explore the trade-offs between performance, storage formats, and schema definitions. A follow-up discussion is included as well to summarize the lessons learned from this effort.},

  abstract = {Until recently, when relational systems was the main data management option and SQL the de facto language for querying/analyzing data, ODBC was an excellent API for applications to interact with the data provider. Standardization of data retrieval has helped innovation and productivity, allowing application developers to focus on the core of their ideas. However, the big data era added variety to all aspects of data facilitation: variety in data management options, variety in data formats, variety in querying/analyzing tasks. In this chaotic situation, standardizing data connectivity is more important than ever. What should be the replacement of ODBC? In this paper, we propose ODMC (Open Data Management Connectivity), a client-server protocol between data management entities (DMEs). A DME is anything that manages/manipulates data. In that respect, spreadsheets, java programs, Hadoop, RDBMs, stream engines, NoSQL, etc., all act as DMEs. In addition, there is no distinction between applications and data management servers, as in ODBC. A DME can be a data consumer in an ODMC instance and a data producer in another. This composability principle allows for the definition of analysis workflows. We present a preliminary implementation of ODMC for python-based DMEs. We argue that ODMC is simple, intuitive, scalable and suitable for both persistent and stream data.},

At the same time, two of the most influential components of this era, Big Data and IoT are moving very fast, on a collision course with the methodologies that are associated with conventional data processing and database systems. As a result, new approaches like NoSQL databases, distributed architectures, etc. started appearing on the stage. Meanwhile, another technology, ontology and semantic data processing can be a very convenient catalyzer that might assist in smoothly providing this transformation process. In this paper, we propose a combined framework that brings Big Data, IoT, and semantic web together to build an augmented framework for this new era. We not only list the components of such a system and define the necessary bindings that needs to be integrated together, but also provide a realistic use case that demonstrates how the model can implement the desired functionality and achieve the goals of such a model.},

@inproceedings{qader2018comparative,
  abstract = {NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data applications, because they achieve fast write throughput and fast lookups on the primary key. Many of these applications also require queries on non-primary attributes. For that reason, several NoSQL databases have added support for secondary indexes. However, these works are fragmented, as each system generally supports one type of secondary index, and may be using different names or no name at all to refer to such indexes. As there is no single system that supports all types of secondary indexes, no experimental head-to-head comparison or performance analysis of the various secondary indexing techniques in terms of throughput and space exists. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of NoSQL secondary indexes, broadly split into two classes: Embedded Indexes (i.e. lightweight filters embedded inside the primary table) and Stand-Alone Indexes (i.e. separate data structures). To ensure the fairness of our comparative study, we built a system, LevelDB++, on top of Google's popular open-source LevelDB key-value store. There, we implemented two Embedded Indexes and three state-of-the-art Stand-Alone indexes, which cover most of the popular NoSQL databases. Our comprehensive experimental study and theoretical evaluation show that none of these indexing techniques dominate the others: the embedded indexes offer superior write throughput and are more space efficient, whereas the stand-alone secondary indexes achieve faster query response times. Thus, the optimal choice of secondary index depends on the application workload. This paper provides an empirical guideline for choosing secondary indexes},

Selection of an appropriate set of indexes for the workload processed by the database system is an important part of physical design and performance tuning. This selection is a non-trivial tasks, especially considering possible number of native indexes in modern databases. We introduce a new approach to the index selection problem using data mining. The method recommends the creation of indexes as well as the type of each index. This results in more precise index recommendations that allows not only to create ascending and descending indexes, but also special indexes supported by the database system. Mining of queries results in candidate indexes for which virtual indexes get created. As the approach does not require modifications of the database system, it is generically applicable. Evaluations of the scalability are given for different workloads for the document-based NoSQL database MongoDB.},

  abstract = {Building scalable web applications on top of NoSQL data stores is becoming common practice. Many of these data stores can easily be accessed programmatically, and do not enforce a schema. Software engineers can design the data model on the go, a flexibility that is crucial in agile software development. The typical tasks of database schema management are now handled within the application code, usually involving object mapper libraries. However, today's Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) lack the proper tool support when it comes to managing the combined evolution of the application code and of the schema. Yet simple refactorings such as renaming an attribute at the source code level can cause irretrievable data loss or runtime errors once the application is serving in production. In this demo, we present ControVol, a framework for controlled schema evolution in application development against NoSQL data stores. ControVol is integrated into the IDE and statically type checks object mapper class declarations against the schema evolution history, as recorded by the code repository. ControVol is capable of warning of common yet risky cases of mismatched data and schema. ControVol is further able to suggest quick fixes by which developers can have these issues automatically resolved.},

  abstract = {In-memory transactional data girds, often referred to as NoSQL data grids demand high concurrency for scalability and high performance in data-intensive applications. As an alternative concurrency control model, distributed transactional memory (DTM) promises to alleviate the difficulties of lock-based distributed synchronization. We consider the multi-versioning (MV) model of using multiple object versions in DTM to avoid unnecessary aborts. MV transactional memory inherently guarantees commits of read-only transactions, but limits concurrency of write transactions. We present a transactional scheduler, called partial rollback-based transactional scheduler (or PTS), for a multi-versioned DTM model. The model supports multiple object versions to exploit concurrency of read-only transactions, and detects conflicts of write transactions at an object level. Instead of aborting a transaction, PTS assigns backoff times for conflicting transactions, and the transaction is rolled-back partially. Our implementation, integrated with a popular open-source transactional in-memory data store (i.e., Red Hat's Infinispan) reveals that PTS improves transactional throughput over MV DTM without PTS by as much as 2.4√ó.},

  abstract = {The W3C's Resource Description Framework (or RDF, in short) is set to deliver many of the original semi-structured data promises: flexible structure, optional schema, and rich, flexible URIs as a basis for information sharing. Moreover, RDF is uniquely positioned to benefit from the efforts of scientific communities studying databases, knowledge representation, and Web technologies. As a consequence, numerous collections of RDF data are published, going from scientific data to general-purpose ontologies to open government data, in particular published as part of the Linked Data movement. Managing such large volumes of RDF data is challenging, due to the sheer size, the heterogeneity, and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. To tackle the size challenge, distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing is an emerging distributed paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability, fault-tolerance and elasticity features it provides. This tutorial presents the challenges faced in order to efficiently handle massive amounts of RDF data in a cloud environment. We provide the necessary background, analyze and classify existing solutions, and discuss open problems and perspectives.},

  abstract = {The age of cloud computing has introduced all the mechanisms needed to elastically scale distributed, cloud-enabled applications. At roughly the same time, NoSQL databases have been proclaimed as the scalable alternative to relational databases. Since then, NoSQL databases are a core component of many large-scale distributed applications. This paper evaluates the scalability and elasticity features of the three widely used NoSQL database systems Couchbase, Cassandra and MongoDB under various workloads and settings using throughput and latency as metrics. The numbers show that the three database systems have dramatically different baselines with respect to both metrics and also behave unexpected when scaling out. For instance, while Couchbase's throughput increases by 17% when scaled out from 1 to 4 nodes, MongoDB's throughput decreases by more than 50%. These surprising results show that not all tested NoSQL databases do scale as expected and even worse, in some cases scaling harms performances.},

However, NoSQL databases integrate poor data protection features with basic coarse grained access control and no support for context aware policies. Therefore, we believe that a general approach is required to enhance NoSQL datastores with fine grained context aware access control. In this paper, we start to fill this void by targeting MongoDB, a very popular datastore. The contribution is twofold. We enhance MongoDB's access control model with advanced features and we define an enforcement monitor for the proposed enhanced model, which can be straightforwardly used in any MongoDB deployment. Technological limitations of MongoDB do not allow implementing the same efficient enforcement mechanism for all query types. As a consequence, experimental results show an enforcement overhead that is significant for aggregate queries, which contrasts with a low overhead measured for find and map-reduce queries.},

In this lightning talk, we apply pending schema changes to records that have been persisted several schema versions back. We present first experiments with MongoDB and Cassandra, where we explore the trade-off between applying chains of pending changes stepwise (one after the other), and as composite operations. Contrary to intuition, composite migration is not necessarily faster. The culprit is the computational overhead for deriving the compositions. However, caching composition formulae achieves a speed up: For Cassandra, we can cut the runtime by nearly 80%. Surprisingly, the relative speedup seems to be system-dependent. Our take away message is that in applying pending schema changes in NoSQL data stores, we need to base our design decisions on experimental evidence rather than on intuition alone.},

@inproceedings{li2017scheduling,
  abstract = {In the era of big data, many tools and algorithms are designed to deal with the increasing data. Because data management on the traditional relational database causes scalability and performance problem, data management across multiple data centers has been proposed. Cassandra is a NoSQL database, which is built to store huge volumes of data and manage data across multiple data centers. Generally, Cassandra assign data to different nodes based on consistent hashing algorithm. So the performance of Cassandra is excellent when most random read and write are requested. However, when the popular data is read or written frequently and the data is distributed to different data centers. Each operation brings the communication delay that could not be ignored. In this article, we propose a scheduling strategy based on multi-queues to reduce communication delay when data are accessed across different data centers. To validate the effectiveness of this strategy, we implemented our approach on Cassandra and evaluation results showed the average response time of data access is reduced across multiple data centers.},

@book{georgiou2011cooperative,
  abstract = {Cooperative network supercomputing is becoming increasingly popular for harnessing the power of the global Internet computing platform. A typical Internet supercomputer consists of a master computer or server and a large number of computers called workers, performing computation on behalf of the master. Despite the simplicity and benefits of a single master approach, as the scale of such computing environments grows, it becomes unrealistic to assume the existence of the infallible master that is able to coordinate the activities of multitudes of workers. Large-scale distributed systems are inherently dynamic and are subject to perturbations, such as failures of computers and network links, thus it is also necessary to consider fully distributed peer-to-peer solutions.

We present a study of cooperative computing with the focus on modeling distributed computing settings, algorithmic techniques enabling one to combine efficiency and fault-tolerance in distributed systems, and the exposition of trade-offs between efficiency and fault-tolerance for robust cooperative computing. The focus of the exposition is on the abstract problem, called Do-All, and formulated in terms of a system of cooperating processors that together need to perform a collection of tasks in the presence of adversity. Our presentation deals with models, algorithmic techniques, and analysis. Our goal is to present the most interesting approaches to algorithm design and analysis leading to many fundamental results in cooperative distributed computing. The algorithms selected for inclusion are among the most efficient that additionally serve as good pedagogical examples. Each chapter concludes with exercises and bibliographic notes that include a wealth of references to related work and relevant advanced results.},

  abstract = {As applications are becoming increasingly dynamic, the notion that a schema can be created in advance for an application and remain relatively stable is becoming increasingly unrealistic. This has pushed application developers away from traditional relational database systems and away from the SQL interface, despite their many well-established benefits. Instead, developers often prefer self-describing data models such as JSON, and NoSQL systems designed specifically for their relaxed semantics.

In this paper, we discuss the design of a system that enables developers to continue to represent their data using self-describing formats without moving away from SQL and traditional relational database systems. Our system stores arbitrary documents of key-value pairs inside physical and virtual columns of a traditional relational database system, and adds a layer above the database system that automatically provides a dynamic relational view to the user against which fully standard SQL queries can be issued. We demonstrate that our design can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in performance over alternative solutions, including existing relational database JSON extensions, MongoDB, and shredding systems that store flattened key-value data inside a relational database.},

  abstract = {In the era of big data and cloud, distributed key-value stores are increasingly used as building blocks of large-scale applications. Comparing to traditional relational databases, key-value stores are particularly compelling due to their low latency and excellent scalability. Many big companies, such as Facebook and Amazon, run multiple different applications and services on top of a single key-value store deployment to reduce the deployment and maintenance complexity as well as economic cost. However, every application has its performance requirement but most current key-value store systems are designed to serve every application request equally. This design works well when a single application accesses the key-value store, but it is not as good for the emerging concurrent multi-application scenario. In this paper, we present ZHT/Q, a flexible QoS (Quality of Service) fortified distributed key-value storage system for clouds and data centers. It improves the overall throughput by an order of magnitude and still satisfies different applications' latency requirements with QoS using dynamic and adaptive request batching mechanisms. The experiment results show that our new system delivers up to 28 times higher throughput than the base solution while more than 99% of requests' latency requirements are satisfied.},

In particular, products typically ship without integrated support for management features rendered conventional by the long history of RDBMSs, such as sophisticated query processing systems, join operations, aggregate functions, and integrity constraints. The design decision forces users of NoSQL technologies to find alternative methods for providing missing tools by engaging either directly or indirectly in a suboptimal k-implementation cycle as developers re-invent new instances of the same data management tools across NoSQL products.

However, most of these systems poorly support data security, and recent surveys show that their simplistic support for data protection is considered as a reason not to use them.1 In recent years, Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is getting more and more popularity, for its ability to provide highly flexible and customized forms of data protection at different granularity levels. In the current work, with the aim to raise users' confidence in the protection of data managed by NoSQL systems, we define a general approach to enforce ABAC within NoSQL systems. Our approach relies on SQL++[20], a unifying query language for NoSQL platforms. In particular, we develop a novel SQL++ query rewriting mechanism able to enforce heterogeneous types of ABAC policies specified up to cell level. Experimental results show an overhead which is not negligible for policies covering high percentage of the fields characterizing the protected documents, but which is far more contained when field level policies are more sparsely specified.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present RASP, a system that combines latest distributed stream processing and NoSQL engines to enable the real-time low latency storage and joining of incoming data streams with external datasets of arbitrary sizes through an extensible, SQL compliant manner. We achieve low latency, real time execution by employing the Kafka and Storm frameworks to join incoming tuples as they arrive, while the denormalized result is being stored in HBase, a distributed NoSQL engine with the use of Phoenix, a framework that fully supports SQL. We fine-tune the topology execution to achieve maximum performance and we also apply a set of optimizations both in the HBase storage and the Phoenix SQL execution framework. We use RASP to solve a network analytics problem using real data. RASP performs its computations utilizing an extensible pipeline of Storm bolts that incrementally augment incoming tuples with the execution of different algorithms. We deploy our system over an IaaS cloud and we evaluate its performance for various workloads, cluster sizes and configurations, where we show that in some cases RASP achieves a throughput increase of more than 140% and a latency drop of more than 65% compared to a vanilla setting.},

  abstract = {Social networking users have the ability to check into Points of Interest (POIs) and associate location with their posts or tweets, leading to the creation of Geo-Social Networks (GeoSNs). There are many systems that aim to efficiently store and analyze plain and socially enhanced spatio-temporal data. A proper evaluation of these systems should be done using real data from popular GeoSNs, such as Foursquare, Facebook, etc. However, privacy restrictions prohibit the access to such real data in a large scale. Therefore, evaluations are done using real or synthetic data sets that include either only spatio-textual data (e.g. tweets) or plain spatial data (e.g. GPS traces) that are not socially enhanced. In this paper, we present Spaten, an open-source configurable spatio-temporal and textual data set generator, that extracts GPS traces from realistic routes utilizing Google Maps API, combines them with real POIs and relevant user comments crawled from TripAdvisor and makes the data available for further analysis. The injection of social properties extracted by existing Twitter graphs to the generated data along with further parameterization leads to realistic GeoSN data sets. We create and publicly offer GB-size datasets with millions of check-ins and GPS traces. As a proof of concept, we loaded the generated data into a Big Data enabled NoSQL system, and we evaluated its scalability by performing queries typically found in social networking sites. We hope that Spaten can provide the research community with the ability to generate realistic GeoSN data in a large scale, so as to properly evaluate their work.},

@inproceedings{kang2014durable,
  abstract = {In order to meet the stringent requirements of low latency as well as high throughput, web service providers with large data centers have been replacing magnetic disk drives with flash memory solid-state drives (SSDs). They commonly use relational and NoSQL database engines to manage OLTP workloads in the warehouse-scale computing environments. These modern database engines rely heavily on redundant writes and frequent cache flushes to guarantee the atomicity and durability of transactional updates. This has become a serious bottleneck of performance in both relational and NoSQL database engines. This paper presents a new SSD prototype called DuraSSD equipped with tantalum capacitors. The tantalum capacitors make the device cache inside DuraSSD durable, and additional firmware features of DuraSSD take advantage of the durable cache to support the atomicity and durability of page writes. It is the first time that a flash memory SSD with durable cache has been used to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in transaction throughput without compromising the atomicity and durability. Considering that the simple capacitors increase the total cost of an SSD no more than one percent, DuraSSD clearly provides a cost-effective means for transactional support. DuraSSD is also expected to alleviate the problem of high tail latency by minimizing write stalls.},

In this demonstration, we present a Cloud Multidatastore Query Language (CloudMdsQL), and its query engine. CloudMdsQL is a functional SQL-like language, capable of querying multiple heterogeneous data stores (relational and NoSQL) within a single query that may contain embedded invocations to each data store's native query interface. The major innovation is that a CloudMdsQL query can exploit the full power of local data stores, by simply allowing some local data store native queries (e.g. a breadth-first search query against a graph database) to be called as functions, and at the same time be optimized. Within our demonstration, we focus on two use cases each involving four diverse data stores (graph, document, relational, and key-value) with its corresponding CloudMdsQL queries. The query execution flows are visualized by an embedded real-time monitoring subsystem. The users can also try out different ad-hoc queries, not necessarily in the context of the use cases.},

Darwin assists application developers in essential data and schema curation tasks: Upon request, Darwin extracts a schema description, discovers the history of schema versions, and proposes mappings between these versions. Users of Darwin may interactively choose which mappings are most realistic. Darwin is further capable of rewriting queries at runtime, to ensure that queries also comply with legacy data. Alternatively, Darwin can migrate legacy data to reduce the structural heterogeneity. Using Darwin, developers may thus evolve their data in sync with their code.

  abstract = {Couchbase Server is a rethinking of the database given the current set of realities. Memory today is much cheaper than disks were when traditional databases were designed back in the 1970's, and networks are much faster and much more reliable than ever before. Application agility is also an extremely important requirement. Today's Couchbase Server is a memory- and network-centric, shared-nothing, auto-partitioned, and distributed NoSQL database system that offers both key-based and secondary index-based data access paths as well as API- and query-based data access capabilities. This is a major change from Couchbase's roots; in its early days, its focus was entirely on high performance and highly available key-value (memcache) based caching. Customer needs and competitive pressures in the evolving non-relational database market also accelerated this change. This paper describes the architectural changes needed to address the requirements posed by next-generation database applications. In addition, it details the implementation of such an architecture using Couchbase Server and explains the evolution of Couchbase Server from its early roots to its present form. Particular attention is paid to how today's Couchbase Server cluster architecture is influenced by the memory-first, high-performance, and scalability demands of typical customer deployments. Key features include a layer-consolidated cache, a consistency-controllable interplay between updates, indexes, and queries, and a unique "multi-dimensional" approach to cluster scaling. The paper closes with a look at future plans for supporting semi-structured operational data analytics in addition to today's more OLTP-like, front-facing use cases.},

  abstract = {The study of what can be computed by a team of autonomous mobile robots, originally started in robotics and AI, has become increasingly popular in theoretical computer science (especially in distributed computing), where it is now an integral part of the investigations on computability by mobile entities. The robots are identical computational entities located and able to move in a spatial universe; they operate without explicit communication and are usually unable to remember the past; they are extremely simple, with limited resources, and individually quite weak. However, collectively the robots are capable of performing complex tasks, and form a system with desirable fault-tolerant and self-stabilizing properties. The research has been concerned with the computational aspects of such systems. In particular, the focus has been on the minimal capabilities that the robots should have in order to solve a problem.

This book focuses on the recent algorithmic results in the field of distributed computing by oblivious mobile robots (unable to remember the past). After introducing the computational model with its nuances, we focus on basic coordination problems: pattern formation, gathering, scattering, leader election, as well as on dynamic tasks such as flocking. For each of these problems, we provide a snapshot of the state of the art, reviewing the existing algorithmic results. In doing so, we outline solution techniques, and we analyze the impact of the different assumptions on the robots' computability power.},

In this book we consider the important case of M(n) being a concurrent system, where the number of replicated processes depends on the parameter n but each process is independent of n. Examples are cache coherence protocols, networks of finite-state agents, and systems that solve mutual exclusion or scheduling problems. Further examples are abstractions of systems, where the processes of the original systems actually depend on the parameter.

The literature in this area has studied a wealth of computational models based on a variety of synchronization and communication primitives, including token passing, broadcast, and guarded transitions. Often, different terminology is used in the literature, and results are based on implicit assumptions. In this book, we introduce a computational model that unites the central synchronization and communication primitives of many models, and unveils hidden assumptions from the literature. We survey existing decidability and undecidability results, and give a systematic view of the basic problems in this exciting research area.},

  abstract = {This paper explores scalable implementation strategies for carrying out lazy schema evolution in NoSQL data stores. For decades, schema evolution has been an evergreen in database research. Yet new challenges arise in the context of cloud-hosted data backends: With all database reads and writes charged by the provider, migrating the entire data instance eagerly into a new schema can be prohibitively expensive. Thus, lazy migration may be more cost-efficient, as legacy entities are only migrated in case they are actually accessed by the application. Related work has shown that the overhead of migrating data lazily is affordable when a single evolutionary change is carried out, such as adding a new property. In this paper, we focus on long-term schema evolution, where chains of pending schema evolution operations may have to be applied. Chains occur when legacy entities written several application releases back are finally accessed by the application. We discuss strategies for dealing with chains of evolution operations, in particular, the composition into a single, equivalent composite migration that performs the required version jump. Our experiments with MongoDB focus on scalable implementation strategies. Our lineup further compares the number of write operations, and thus, the operational costs of different data migration strategies.},

@inproceedings{ozcan2017hybrid,
  abstract = {The popularity of large-scale real-time analytics applications (real-time inventory/pricing, recommendations from mobile apps, fraud detection, risk analysis, IoT, etc.) keeps rising. These applications require distributed data management systems that can handle fast concurrent transactions (OLTP) and analytics on the recent data. Some of them even need running analytical queries (OLAP) as part of transactions. Efficient processing of individual transactional and analytical requests, however, leads to different optimizations and architectural decisions while building a data management system.

For the kind of data processing that requires both analytics and transactions, Gartner recently coined the term Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP). Many HTAP solutions are emerging both from the industry as well as academia that target these new applications. While some of these are single system solutions, others are a looser coupling of OLTP databases or NoSQL systems with analytical big data platforms, like Spark. The goal of this tutorial is to 1-) quickly review the historical progression of OLTP and OLAP systems, 2-) discuss the driving factors for HTAP, and finally 3-) provide a deep technical analysis of existing and emerging HTAP solutions, detailing their key architectural differences and trade-offs.},

  abstract = {The rising adoption of NoSQL technology in enterprises causes a heterogeneous landscape of different data stores. Different stores provide distinct advantages and disadvantages, making it necessary for enterprises to facilitate multiple systems for specific purposes. This resulting polyglot persistence is difficult to handle for developers since some data needs to be replicated and aggregated between different and within the same stores. Currently, there are no uniform tools to perform these data transformations since all stores feature different APIs and data models. In this paper, we present the transformation language NotaQL that allows cross-system data transformations. These transformations are output-oriented, meaning that the structure of a transformation script is similar to that of the output. Besides, we provide an aggregation-centric approach, which makes aggregation operations as easy as possible.},

@inproceedings{maccioni2016quepa,
  abstract = {Polystore systems (or simply polystores) have been recently proposed to support a common scenario in which enterprise data are stored in a variety of database technologies relying on different data models and languages. Polystores provide a loosely coupled integration of data sources and support the direct access, with the local language, to each specific storage engine to exploit its distinctive features. Given the absence of a global schema, new challenges for accessing data arise in these environments. In fact, it is usually hard to know in advance if a query to a specific data store can be satisfied with data stored elsewhere in the polystore. QUEPA addresses these issues by introducing augmented search and augmented exploration in a polystore, two access methods based on the automatic enrichment of the result of a query over a storage system with related data in the rest of the polystore. These features do not impact on the applications running on top of the polystore and are compatible with the most common database systems. QUEPA implements in this way a lightweight mechanism for data integration in the polystore and operates in a plug-and-play mode, thus reducing the need for ad-hoc configurations and for middleware layers involving standard APIs, unified query languages or shared data models. In our demonstration audience can experience with the augmentation construct by using the native query languages of the database systems available in the polystore.},

@inproceedings{huang2015databasebased,
  abstract = {NoSQL distributed databases have been devised to tackle the challenges resulting from volume, velocity and variety of big data. Graph representation of datasets requires efficient distributed linear algebra operations for large sparse matrix constructed from big data. Storing the transformed matrix into the database not only speeds up the big data analysis process but also facilitates the computation because of indexing. The Hadoop based approach does not natively support iterative algorithms due to data shuffling during each iteration. This paper presents a novel database-based distributed computation architecture bridging the gap between Hadoop and HPC. The novelty results from exploring the indexing capability of D4M (Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model) to support linear algebra operations in a distributed computation environment. The idea is to store input data and intermediate results in associative array format inside Accumulo table to facilitate the data sharing among working nodes. pMatlab is deployed as the parallel computation engine. Our proposed architecture is proved to be lighter, easier and faster than MapReduce based approach. One example application is calculating top k eigenvalues and eigenvectors for large sparse matrix. Experiments on Graph500 benchmark datasets demonstrate 2X speedup of our architecture as compared to HEIGEN (An eigensolver for billion-scale matrices using MapReduce).},

@inproceedings{oh2016share,
  abstract = {Database consistency and recoverability require guaranteeing write atomicity for one or more pages. However, contemporary database systems consider write operations non-atomic. Thus, many database storage engines have traditionally relied on either journaling or copy-on-write approaches for atomic propagation of updated pages to the storage. This reliance achieves write atomicity at the cost of various write amplifications such as redundant writes, tree-wandering, and compaction. This write amplification results in reduced performance and, for flash storage, accelerates device wear-out. In this paper, we propose a flash storage interface, SHARE. Being able to explicitly remap the address mapping inside flash storage using SHARE interface enables host-side database storage engines to achieve write atomicity without causing write amplification. We have implemented SHARE on a real SSD board, OpenSSD, and modified MySQL/InnoDB and Couchbase NoSQL storage engines to make them compatible with the extended SHARE interface. Our experimental results show that this SHARE-based MySQL/InnoDB and Couchbase configurations can significantly boost database performance. In particular, the inevitable and costly Couchbase compaction process can complete without copying any data pages.},

In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization and proofs. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a "delay-sensitivity" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network faults.},

While the problem of schema optimization is also highly relevant for NoSQL databases, existing tools for relational databases are inadequate for this setting. Application designers wishing to use a NoSQL database instead rely on rules of thumb to select an appropriate schema. We present a system for recommending database schemas for NoSQL applications. Our cost-based approach uses a novel binary integer programming formulation to guide the mapping from the application's conceptual data model to a database schema. We implemented a prototype of this approach for the Cassandra extensible record store. Our prototype, the NoSQL Schema Evaluator (NoSE) is able to capture rules of thumb used by expert designers without explicitly encoding the rules. Automating the design process allows NoSE to produce efficient schemas and to examine more alternatives than would be possible with a manual rule-based approach.},

@inproceedings{mckenzie2015finetuning,
  abstract = {NoSQL storage systems are used extensively by web applications and provide an attractive alternative to conventional databases when the need for scalability outweighs the need for transactions. Several of these systems, notably Amazon's Dynamo and its open-source derivatives, provide quorum-based replication and present the application developer with a choice of multiple client-side "consistency levels" that determine the number of replicas accessed by reads and writes. This setting, in turn, affects both the latency and the consistency observed by the client application. Since using a fixed combination of read and write consistency levels for a given application provides only a limited number of discrete options for tuning the consistency-latency trade-off, we investigate techniques that allow more fine-grained tuning as may be required to support consistency guarantees through service level agreements (SLAs). We consider two such techniques, a novel technique that assigns the consistency level on a peroperation basis by choosing randomly between two options (e.g., weak vs. strong consistency) with a tunable probability, and a known technique that uses weak consistency and injects delays into storage operations artificially. We compare and contrast these two techniques experimentally against each other and against combinations of fixed consistency levels using Apache Cassandra deployed in Amazon's EC2 environment.},

The heterogeneity of data formats and the sheer volumes of data collections prohibit cleaning and unifying the data manually. Thus, tools for automated data lake analysis are of great interest. In this paper, we target the particular problem of reconstructing the schema evolution history from data lakes. Knowing how the data is structured, and how this structure has evolved over time, enables programmatic access to the lake. By deriving a sequence of schema versions, rather than a single schema, we take into account structural changes over time. Moreover, we address the challenge of detecting inclusion dependencies. This is a prerequisite for mapping between succeeding schema versions, and in particular, detecting nontrivial changes such as a property having been moved or copied. We evaluate our approach for detecting inclusion dependencies using the MovieLens dataset, as well an adaption of a dataset containing botanical descriptions, to cover specific edge cases.},

  abstract = {Computational Maritime Situational Awareness (MSA) supports the maritime industry, governments, and international organizations with machine learning and big data techniques for analyzing vessel traffic data available through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). A critical challenge of scaling computational MSA to big data regimes is integrating the core learning algorithms with big data storage modes and data models. To address this challenge, we report results from our experimentation with MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database which we test as a supporting platform for computational MSA. We experiment with a document model that avoids database joins when linking position and voyage AIS vessel information and allows tuning the database index and document sizes in response to the AIS data rate. We report results for the AIS data ingested and analyzed daily at the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE).},

  abstract = {Modern replicated data stores aim to provide high availability, by immediately responding to client requests, often by implementing objects that expose concurrency. Such objects, for example, multi-valued registers (MVRs), do not have sequential specifications. This paper explores a recent model for replicated data stores that can be used to precisely specify causal consistency for such objects, and liveness properties like eventual consistency, without revealing details of the underlying implementation. The model is used to prove the following results: An eventually consistent data store implementing MVRs cannot satisfy a consistency model strictly stronger than observable causal consistency (OCC). OCC is a model somewhat stronger than causal consistency, which captures executions in which client observations can use causality to infer concurrency of operations. This result holds under certain assumptions about the data store. Under the same assumptions, an eventually consistent and causally consistent replicated data store must send messages of unbounded size: If s objects are supported by n replicas, then, for every k > 1, there is an execution in which an Œ©({n,s} k)-bit message is sent.},

@book{kaynar2010theory,
  abstract = {This monograph presents the Timed Input/Output Automaton (TIOA) modeling framework, a basic mathematical framework to support description and analysis of timed (computing) systems. Timed systems are systems in which desirable correctness or performance properties of the system depend on the timing of events, not just on the order of their occurrence. Timed systems are employed in a wide range of domains including communications, embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and automated control. Many applications involving timed systems have strong safety, reliability, and predictability requirements, which make it important to have methods for systematic design of systems and rigorous analysis of timing-dependent behavior. The TIOA framework also supports description and analysis of timed distributed algorithms -- distributed algorithms whose correctness and performance depend on the relative speeds of processors, accuracy of local clocks, or communication delay bounds. Such algorithms arise, for example, in traditional and wireless communications, networks of mobile devices, and shared-memory multiprocessors. The need to prove rigorous theoretical results about timed distributed algorithms makes it important to have a suitable mathematical foundation.

An important feature of the TIOA framework is its support for decomposing timed system descriptions. In particular, the framework includes a notion of external behavior for a timed I/O automaton, which captures its discrete interactions with its environment. The framework also defines what it means for one TIOA to implement another, based on an inclusion relationship between their external behavior sets, and defines notions of simulations, which provide sufficient conditions for demonstrating implementation relationships. The framework includes a composition operation for TIOAs, which respects external behavior, and a notion of receptiveness, which implies that a TIOA does not block the passage of time.

The TIOA framework also defines the notion of a property and what it means for a property to be a safety or a liveness property. It includes results that capture common proof methods for showing that automata satisfy properties.},

@inproceedings{chen2015spatiotemporal,
  abstract = {Geoscience gives insights into our surroundings and benefits many aspects of our life. Nowadays, with massive sensors deployed to sense all kinds of parameters for environments, tens of billions, even trillions of sensed data are collected and need to be analyzed for surveillance or other purposes. From many perspectives, users always issue queries according to specific spatial and temporal predicates. For these applications, relational databases are overwhelmed by the large scale and high rate insertions, and NoSQL database could be considered a feasible solution. HBase, a popular key-value store system, is capable to solve the storage problem, but fails to provide in-built spatio-temporal querying capability. Many previous works tackle the problem by designing schema, i.e., designing row key and column key formation for HBase, which we don't believe is an effective solution. In this paper, we address this problem from nature level of HBase, and propose an index structure as a built-in component for HBase. STEHIX (Spatio-TEmporal Hbase IndeX) is adapted to two-level architecture of HBase and suitable for HBase to process spatio-temporal queries. It is composed of index in the meta table (the first level) and region index (the second level) for indexing inner structure of HBase regions. Base on this structure, two common queries, range query and kNN query are solved by proposing algorithms, respectively. For achieving load balancing and scalable kNN query, two optimizations are also presented. We implement STEHIX and conduct experiments on real dataset, and the results show our design outperforms a previous work in many aspects.},

The integration of the JSON data model into the RDBMS allows a new paradigm of data management where data is storable, indexable and queryable without upfront schema definition. We call this new paradigm Flexible Schema Data Management (FSDM). In this paper, we present enhancements to Oracle's JSON data management in the upcoming 12cR2 release. We present JSON DataGuide, an auto-computed dynamic soft schema for JSON collections that closes the functional gap between the fixed-schema SQL world and the schema-less NoSQL world. We present a self-contained query friendly binary format for encoding JSON (OSON) to close the query performance gap between schema-encoded relational data and schema free JSON textual data. The addition of these new features makes the Oracle RDBMS well suited to both fixedschema SQL and flexible-schema NoSQL use cases, and allows users to freely mix the two paradigms in a single data management system.},

@inproceedings{maccioni2018augmented,
  abstract = {The huge diversity of database technologies in use inside organizations pose today new challenges of data management and integration. Polystores provide a solution to this scenario based on a loosely coupled integration of data sources and the direct access, with the local language, to each storage engine for exploiting its distinctive features. However, given the absence of a global schema, it is hard to know if a query to one system can be satisfied with data stored elsewhere in the polystore. We address this issue by introducing query augmentation, a data manipulation operator for polystores based on the automatic enrichment of the answer to a local query with related data in the rest of the polystore. Augmentation can be used to implement two effective methods for data access in polystores: augmented search and augmented exploration. We show that they provide effective tools for information discovery in polystores that avoid middleware layers, abstract query languages, and shared data models. We also illustrate the design of QUEPA, a system that fully implements our approach in an efficient way. A comprehensive campaign of experiments done with QUEPA shows that our approach is feasible and, unlike other approaches, scales nicely as the polystore grows in the number of stores and size of databases.},

  abstract = {The unprecedented scale at which data is consumed and generated today has shown a large demand for scalable data management and given rise to non-relational, distributed ‚ÄúNoSQL‚Äù database systems. Two central problems triggered this process: 1) vast amounts of user-generated content in modern applications and the resulting requests loads and data volumes 2) the desire of the developer community to employ problem-specific data models for storage and querying. To address these needs, various data stores have been developed by both industry and research, arguing that the era of one-size-fits-all database systems is over. The heterogeneity and sheer amount of these systems - now commonly referred to as NoSQL data stores - make it increasingly difficult to select the most appropriate system for a given application. Therefore, these systems are frequently combined in polyglot persistence architectures to leverage each system in its respective sweet spot. This tutorial gives an in-depth survey of the most relevant NoSQL databases to provide comparative classification and highlight open challenges. To this end, we analyze the approach of each system to derive its scalability, availability, consistency, data modeling and querying characteristics. We present how each system's design is governed by a central set of trade-offs over irreconcilable system properties. We then cover recent research results in distributed data management to illustrate that some shortcomings of NoSQL systems could already be solved in practice, whereas other NoSQL data management problems pose interesting and unsolved research challenges.},

@inproceedings{ceesay2017bench,
  abstract = {The recent boom of big data, coupled with the challenges of its processing and storage gave rise to the development of distributed data processing and storage paradigms like MapReduce, Spark, and NoSQL databases. With the advent of cloud computing, processing and storing such massive datasets on clusters of machines is now feasible with ease. However, there are limited tools and approaches, which users can rely on to gauge and comprehend the performance of their big data applications deployed locally on clusters, or in the cloud. Researchers have started exploring this area by providing benchmarking suites suitable for big data applications. However, many of these tools are fragmented, complex to deploy and manage, and do not provide transparency with respect to the monetary cost of benchmarking an application. In this paper, we present Plug And Play Bench (PAPB1): an infrastructure aware abstraction built to integrate and simplify the deployment of big data benchmarking tools on clusters of machines. PAPB automates the tedious process of installing, configuring and executing common big data benchmark workloads by containerising the tools and settings based on the underlying cluster deployment framework. Our proof of concept implementation utilises HiBench as the benchmark suite, HDP as the cluster deployment framework and Azure as the cloud platform. The paper further illustrates the inclusion of cost metrics based on the underlying Microsoft Azure cloud platform.},

@book{welch2011reversal,
  abstract = {Link reversal is a versatile algorithm design technique that has been used in numerous distributed algorithms for a variety of problems. The common thread in these algorithms is that the distributed system is viewed as a graph, with vertices representing the computing nodes and edges representing some other feature of the system (for instance, point-to-point communication channels or a conflict relationship). Each algorithm assigns a virtual direction to the edges of the graph, producing a directed version of the original graph. As the algorithm proceeds, the virtual directions of some of the links in the graph change in order to accomplish some algorithm-specific goal. The criterion for changing link directions is based on information that is local to a node (such as the node having no outgoing links) and thus this approach scales well, a feature that is desirable for distributed algorithms.

This monograph presents, in a tutorial way, a representative sampling of the work on link-reversal-based distributed algorithms. The algorithms considered solve routing, leader election, mutual exclusion, distributed queueing, scheduling, and resource allocation. The algorithms can be roughly divided into two types, those that assume a more abstract graph model of the networks, and those that take into account more realistic details of the system. In particular, these more realistic details include the communication between nodes, which may be through asynchronous message passing, and possible changes in the graph, for instance, due to movement of the nodes.

We have not attempted to provide a comprehensive survey of all the literature on these topics. Instead, we have focused in depth on a smaller number of fundamental papers, whose common thread is that link reversal provides a way for nodes in the system to observe their local neighborhoods, take only local actions, and yet cause global problems to be solved. We conjecture that future interesting uses of link reversal are yet to be discovered.},

  abstract = {NoSQL key-value data stores provide an attractive solution for big data management. With the help of data partitioning and replication, those data stores achieve higher levels of availability, scalability and reliability. Such design choices typically exhibit a tradeoff in which data freshness is sacrificed in favor of reduced access latency. At the replica-level, this tradeoff is primarily shaped by the resource allocation strategies deployed for managing the processing of user queries and replica updates. In this demonstration, we showcase AQUAS: a quality-aware scheduler for Cassandra, which allows application developers to specify requirements on quality of service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD). AQUAS efficiently allocates the available replica resources to execute the incoming read/write tasks so that to minimize the penalties incurred by violating those requirements. We demonstrate AQUAS based on our implementation of a microblogging system.},

@book{barenboim2013distributed,
  abstract = {The focus of this monograph is on symmetry breaking problems in the message-passing model of distributed computing. In this model a communication network is represented by a n-vertex graph G = (V,E), whose vertices host autonomous processors. The processors communicate over the edges of G in discrete rounds. The goal is to devise algorithms that use as few rounds as possible.

A typical symmetry-breaking problem is the problem of graph coloring. Denote by Œî the maximum degree of G. While coloring G with Œî + 1 colors is trivial in the centralized setting, the problem becomes much more challenging in the distributed one. One can also compromise on the number of colors, if this allows for more efficient algorithms. Other typical symmetry-breaking problems are the problems of computing a maximal independent set (MIS) and a maximal matching (MM). The study of these problems dates back to the very early days of distributed computing. The founding fathers of distributed computing laid firm foundations for the area of distributed symmetry breaking already in the eighties. In particular, they showed that all these problems can be solved in randomized logarithmic time. Also, Linial showed that an O(Œî2)-coloring can be solved very efficiently deterministically.

However, fundamental questions were left open for decades. In particular, it is not known if the MIS or the (Œî + 1)-coloring can be solved in deterministic polylogarithmic time. Moreover, until recently it was not known if in deterministic polylogarithmic time one can color a graph with significantly fewer than Œî2 colors. Additionally, it was open (and still open to some extent) if one can have sublogarithmic randomized algorithms for the symmetry breaking problems.

Recently, significant progress was achieved in the study of these questions. More efficient deterministic and randomized (Œî + 1)-coloring algorithms were achieved. Deterministic Œî1 + o(1)-coloring algorithms with polylogarithmic running time were devised. Improved (and often sublogarithmic-time) randomized algorithms were devised. Drastically improved lower bounds were given. Wide families of graphs in which these problems are solvable much faster than on general graphs were identified.

The objective of our monograph is to cover most of these developments, and as a result to provide a treatise on theoretical foundations of distributed symmetry breaking in the message-passing model. We hope that our monograph will stimulate further progress in this exciting area.},

Quorum systems are the key mathematical abstraction for ensuring consistency in fault-tolerant and highly available distributed computing. Critical for many applications since the early days of distributed computing, quorum systems have evolved from simple majorities of a set of processes to complex hierarchical collections of sets, tailored for general adversarial structures. The initial non-empty intersection property has been refined many times to account for, e.g., stronger (Byzantine) adversarial model, latency considerations or better availability. This monograph is an overview of the evolution and refinement of quorum systems, with emphasis on their role in two fundamental applications: distributed read/write storage and consensus.},

@book{guerraoui2010principles,
  abstract = {Transactional memory (TM) is an appealing paradigm for concurrent programming on shared memory architectures. With a TM, threads of an application communicate, and synchronize their actions, via in-memory transactions. Each transaction can perform any number of operations on shared data, and then either commit or abort. When the transaction commits, the effects of all its operations become immediately visible to other transactions; when it aborts, however, those effects are entirely discarded. Transactions are atomic: programmers get the illusion that every transaction executes all its operations instantaneously, at some single and unique point in time. Yet, a TM runs transactions concurrently to leverage the parallelism offered by modern processors. The aim of this book is to provide theoretical foundations for transactional memory. This includes defining a model of a TM, as well as answering precisely when a TM implementation is correct, what kind of properties it can ensure, what are the power and limitations of a TM, and what inherent trade-offs are involved in designing a TM algorithm. While the focus of this book is on the fundamental principles, its goal is to capture the common intuition behind the semantics of TMs and the properties of existing TM implementations.},

Metadata is critical for scientific research, as it enables discovering, analysing, reusing, and sharing of scientific data. Moreover, metadata produced by scientific experiments is heterogeneous and subject to frequent changes, demanding a flexible data model. Currently, there does not exist an adaptive and a generic solution that is capable of handling heterogeneous metadata models. To address this challenge, we present MetaStore, an adaptive metadata management framework based on a NoSQL database. To handle heterogeneous metadata models and standards, the MetaStore automatically generates the necessary software code (services) and extends the functionality of the framework. To leverage the functionality of NoSQL databases, the MetaStore framework allows full-text search over metadata through automated creation of indexes.

  abstract = {dbDedup is a similarity-based deduplication scheme for on-line database management systems (DBMSs). Beyond block-level compression of individual database pages or operation log (oplog) messages, as used in today's DBMSs, dbDedup uses byte-level delta encoding of individual records within the database to achieve greater savings. dbDedup's single-pass encoding method can be integrated into the storage and logging components of a DBMS to provide two benefits: (1) reduced size of data stored on disk beyond what traditional compression schemes provide, and (2) reduced amount of data transmitted over the network for replication services. To evaluate our work, we implemented dbDedup in a distributed NoSQL DBMS and analyzed its properties using four real datasets. Our results show that dbDedup achieves up to 37x reduction in the storage size and replication traffic of the database on its own and up to 61x reduction when paired with the DBMS's block-level compression. dbDedup provides both benefits with negligible effect on DBMS throughput or client latency (average and tail).},

  abstract = {The use of cloud computing has gained extreme popularity. Through cloud platforms that provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS), users can elastically provision resources enabling automated application throttling. Usually, scaling is either manually performed or through a service that dynamically consolidates cloud resources based on a predefined policy. However, these policies are simplistic, threshold based and may not be able to capture specific application behaviors according to configuration parameters and applied workload type. In this work, we extend TIRAMOLA, a cloud-enabled framework that allows automated resizing of NoSQL clusters, in order to identify different workload types and apply the most beneficial scaling action according to user defined policies. We perform a thorough analysis of how different query types are handled by modern NoSQL systems and evaluate the performance of a NoSQL cluster of varying size, over mixed workload types and magnitudes. We utilize this knowledge to fine tune the extended TIRAMOLA's policies in order to take accurate scaling decisions. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of workload aware and unaware versions on an HBase cluster and our analysis confirms that the former can operate successfully in any environment, behaving accordingly to any input load.},

  abstract = {Data historians[1] are today transitioning from their traditional role as record-keepers and planners, to tools that provide the required flexibility and responsiveness to customers' requirements in terms of the type and volume of data stored, archived and queried. Added dimensions to these requirements are the need for high performance and scalability. Businesses are realizing that traditional database management systems i.e. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) might not be able to handle the deluge of industrial data they are experiencing. With the emerging NoSQL paradigm, there are different kinds of datastores which addresses specific requirements such as improved performance, reliability or user experience. Our study of two NoSQL datastores, HBase and Cassandra, provide the required insights for business units to choose the right technology for their next generation historian systems. To facilitate this study, we propose and use a benchmarking studio that has the ability to generate data for a configurable schema and workload patterns, thus enabling us to perform business use-case specific evaluation of datastores while measuring the key performance indicators. Two industrial cases in the plant automation and energy management are considered for this evaluation. Efficient data modeling techniques and batching mechanisms are defined to store streaming time-series data from sensors and devices with high throughput of approximately one million inserts/second. Mixed workload scenarios are considered to align with the requirements of next generation historians. Detailed experiments for the evaluation of concurrency and load management, scalability, consistency, BI query performance and fault-tolerance are performed on Amazon EC2 dedicated infrastructure for reproducibility and verifiability in the future.},

@inproceedings{papakonstantinou2016semistructured,
  abstract = {Numerous databases promoted as SQL-on-Hadoop, NewSQL and NoSQL support semi-structured, schemaless and heterogeneous data, typically in the form of enriched JSON. They also provide corresponding query languages. In addition to these genuine JSON databases, relational databases also provide special functions and language features for the support of JSON columns, typically piggybacking on non-1NF (non first normal form) features that SQL acquired over the years. We refer to SQL databases with JSON support as SQL/JSON databases.

The evolving query languages present multiple variations: Some are superficial syntactic ones, while other ones are genuine differences in modeling, language capabilities and semantics. Incompatibility with SQL presents a learning challenge for genuine JSON databases, while the table orientation of SQL/JSON databases often leads to cumbersome syntactic/semantic structures that are contrary to the semistructured nature of JSON. Furthermore, the query languages often fall short of full-fledged semistructured query language capabilities, when compared to the yardstick set by XQuery and prior works on semistructured data (even after superficial model differences are abstracted out).

We survey features, the designers' options and differences in the approaches taken by actual systems. In particular, we first present a SQL backwards-compatible language, named SQL++, which can access both SQL and JSON data. SQL++ is expected to be supported by Couchbase's CouchDB and UCI's AsterixDB semistructured databases. Then we expand SQL++ into the Configurable SQL++, whereas multiple possible (and different) semantics are formally captured by the multiple options that the language's semantic configuration options can take. We show how appropriate setting of the configuration options morphs the Configurable SQL++ semantics into the semantics of 10 surveyed languages, hence providing a compact and formal tool to understand the essential semantic differences between different systems. We briefly comment on the utility of formally capturing semantic variations in polystore systems.

Finally we discuss the comparison with prior nested and semistructured query languages (notably OQL and XQuery) and describe a key aspect of query processor implementation: set-oriented semistructured query algebras. In particular, we transfer into the JSON era lessons from the semistructured query processing research of the 90s and 00s and combine them with insights on current JSON databases. Again, the tutorial presents the algebras' fundamentals while it abstracts away modeling differences that are not applicable.},

Availabilay is achieved through replication. By having inore than one copy of information, a service continues to be usable even when some copies are inaccessible, for example, because of a crash of the computer where a copy was stored. This paper presents a new replication algorithm that has desirable performance properties. Our approach is based on the primary copy technique. Computations run at a primary. which notifies its backups of what it has done. If the primary crashes, the backups are reorganized, and one of the backups becomes the new primary. Our method works in a general network with both node crashes and partitions. Replication causes little delay in user computations and little information is lost in a reorganization; we use a special kind of timestamp called a viewstamp to detect lost information.},

Since ZooKeeper is part of critical infrastructure, ZooKeeper aims to provide a simple and high performance kernel for building more complex coordination primitives at the client. It incorporates elements from group messaging, shared registers, and distributed lock services in a replicated, centralized service. The interface exposed by ZooKeeper has the wait-free aspects of shared registers with an event-driven mechanism similar to cache invalidations of distributed file systems to provide a simple, yet powerful coordination service. The ZooKeeper interface enables a high-performance service implementation. In addition to the wait-free property, ZooKeeper provides a per client guarantee of FIFO execution of requests and linearizability for all requests that change the ZooKeeper state. These design decisions enable the implementation of a high performance processing pipeline with read requests being satisfied by local servers. We show for the target workloads, 2:1 to 100:1 read to write ratio, that ZooKeeper can handle tens to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. This performance allows ZooKeeper to be used extensively by client applications.},

  abstract = {A vast array of devices, ranging from industrial robots to self-driven cars or smartphones, require increasingly sophisticated processing of real-world input data (image, voice, radio, ...). Interestingly, hardware neural network accelerators are emerging again as attractive candidate architectures for such tasks. The neural network algorithms considered come from two, largely separate, domains: machine-learning and neuroscience. These neural networks have very different characteristics, so it is unclear which approach should be favored for hardware implementation. Yet, few studies compare them from a hardware perspective. We implement both types of networks down to the layout, and we compare the relative merit of each approach in terms of energy, speed, area cost, accuracy and functionality.

Within the limit of our study (current SNN and machine-learning NN algorithms, current best effort at hardware implementation efforts, and workloads used in this study), our analysis helps dispel the notion that hardware neural network accelerators inspired from neuroscience, such as SNN+STDP, are currently a competitive alternative to hardware neural networks accelerators inspired from machine-learning, such as MLP+BP: not only in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of hardware cost for realistic implementations, which is less expected. However, we also outline that SNN+STDP carry potential for reduced hardware cost compared to machine-learning networks at very large scales, if accuracy issues can be controlled (or for applications where they are less important). We also identify the key sources of inaccuracy of SNN+STDP which are less related to the loss of information due to spike coding than to the nature of the STDP learning algorithm. Finally, we outline that for the category of applications which require permanent online learning and moderate accuracy, SNN+STDP hardware accelerators could be a very cost-efficient solution.},

  abstract = {Principles of Big Data helps readers avoid the common mistakes that endanger all Big Data projects. By stressing simple, fundamental concepts, this book teaches readers how to organize large volumes of complex data, and how to achieve data permanence when the content of the data is constantly changing. General methods for data verification and validation, as specifically applied to Big Data resources, are stressed throughout the book. The book demonstrates how adept analysts can find relationships among data objects held in disparate Big Data resources, when the data objects are endowed with semantic support (i.e., organized in classes of uniquely identified data objects). Readers will learn how their data can be integrated with data from other resources, and how the data extracted from Big Data resources can be used for purposes beyond those imagined by the data creators.

Learn general methods for specifying Big Data in a way that is understandable to humans and to computers
Avoid the pitfalls in Big Data design and analysis
Understand how to create and use Big Data safely and responsibly with a set of laws, regulations and ethical standards that apply to the acquisition, distribution and integration of Big Data resources},

In addition to discussing challenges involved with building large neural models, we identify several expected benefits of pursuing such a research program. We argue that these benefits are only likely to be realized if two basic guidelines are made central to the pursuit. The first is that such models need to be intimately tied to behavior. The second is that models, and more importantly their underlying methods, should provide mechanisms for varying the level of simulated detail. Consequently, we express concerns with models that insist on a `correct' amount of detail while expecting interesting behavior to simply emerge. },

However, they suffer from two key technical problems that make them slow and unwieldy for large-scale NLP tasks: they can only operate on parsed sentences and they do not directly support batched computation. We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing and interpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integrating tree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure of a shift-reduce parser. Our model supports batched computation for a speedup of up to 25x over other tree-structured models, and its integrated parser allows it to operate on unparsed data with little loss of accuracy. We evaluate it on the Stanford NLI entailment task and show that it significantly outperforms other sentence-encoding models.},

Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various properties a representation should have, while still others have focused on properties that are important to the notion of representation in general. In this paper we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and at times conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.},

@article{balduzzi2015semantics,
  abstract = {Deep learning is currently the subject of intensive study. However, fundamental concepts such as representations are not formally defined -- researchers "know them when they see them" -- and there is no common language for describing and analyzing algorithms. This essay proposes an abstract framework that identifies the essential features of current practice and may provide a foundation for future developments.

The backbone of almost all deep learning algorithms is backpropagation, which is simply a gradient computation distributed over a neural network. The main ingredients of the framework are thus, unsurprisingly: (i) game theory, to formalize distributed optimization; and (ii) communication protocols, to track the flow of zeroth and first-order information. The framework allows natural definitions of semantics (as the meaning encoded in functions), representations (as functions whose semantics is chosen to optimized a criterion) and grammars (as communication protocols equipped with first-order convergence guarantees).

Much of the essay is spent discussing examples taken from the literature. The ultimate aim is to develop a graphical language for describing the structure of deep learning algorithms that backgrounds the details of the optimization procedure and foregrounds how the components interact. Inspiration is taken from probabilistic graphical models and factor graphs, which capture the essential structural features of multivariate distributions.},

Image retrieval is considered as a challenge task because of the gap between low-level image representation and high-level textual query representation. Recently further developed deep neural network sheds light on narrowing the gap by learning high-level image representation from raw pixels. In this paper, we proposed a bag-of-words based deep neural network for image retrieval task, which learns high-level image representation and maps images into bag-of-words space. The DNN model is trained on the large scale clickthrough data, and the relevance between query and image is measured by the cosine similarity of query's bag-of-words representation and image's bag-of-words representation predicted by DNN, the visual similarity of images is computed by high-level image representation extracted via the DNN model too. Finally, PageRank algorithm is used to further improve the ranking list by considering visual similarity of images for each query. The experimental results achieved state-of-the-art performance and verified the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Our first experiment evaluates whether these models can learn the basic algebra of logical relations involved. Our second and third experiments extend this evaluation to complex recursive structures and sentences involving quantification.

Manual encoding of linguistic information is being challenged by automated corpus-based learning as a method of providing a natural language processing system with linguistic knowledge.

This can make it difficult to analyze, understand and improve the ability of these approaches to model underlying linguistic behavior.

Procedural knowledge is represented in units called production rules, and declarative knowledge is represented in units called chunks. The individual units are created by simple encodings of objects in the environment (chunks) or simple encodings of transformations in the environment (production rules). A great many such knowledge units underlie human cognition. From this large database, the appropriate units are selected for a particular context by activation processes that are tuned to the statistical structure of the environment. According to the ACT-R theory, the power of human cognition depends on the amount of knowledge encoded and the effective deployment of the encoded knowledge},

@article{gruber1993translation,
  abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse ‚Äî definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects ‚Äî is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations.

We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

These modules are associated with distinct cortical regions. These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes.

@book{frankish2012cambridge,
  abstract = {Cognitive science is a cross-disciplinary enterprise devoted to understanding the nature of the mind. In recent years, investigators in philosophy, psychology, the neurosciences, artificial intelligence, and a host of other disciplines have come to appreciate how much they can learn from one another about the various dimensions of cognition. The result has been the emergence of one of the most exciting and fruitful areas of inter-disciplinary research in the history of science.

This volume of original essays surveys foundational, theoretical, and philosophical issues across the discipline, and introduces the foundations of cognitive science, the principal areas of research, and the major research programs. With a focus on broad philosophical themes rather than detailed technical issues, the volume will be valuable not only to cognitive scientists and philosophers of cognitive science, but also to those in other disciplines looking for an authoritative and up-to-date introduction to the field.

Each chapter is a specially commissioned survey article from a leading writer in the area ‚Äì either a philosopher of cognitive science or a scientist with strong theoretical interests. The approach is thematic rather than historical, and the chapters are primarily survey pieces, though critical assessment is also included, where appropriate. The volume will be suitable for upper-level undergraduates, graduate students, and scholars, with a particular emphasis on the second group. No extensive background knowledge is assumed, either in philosophy or the primary subject areas themselves.

A companion Handbook of Artificial Intelligence has been prepared by the same editors, and the two volumes have been conceived as a pair.
Features
‚Ä¢ Technical jargon is avoided as far as possible and no significant background knowledge of the field is assumed

Configuration of object parts is captured by the patterns of coincident high probability sequences. This knowledge is then encoded in a highly efficient Bayesian network structure. The learning algorithm uses a temporal stability criterion to discover object concepts and movement patterns. We show that the architecture and algorithms are biologically plausible. The large scale architecture of the system matches the large scale organization of the cortex and the micro-circuits derived from the local computations match the anatomical data on cortical circuits. The system exhibits invariance across a wide variety of transformations and is robust in the presence of noise. Moreover, the model also offers alternative explanations for various known cortical phenomena.},

However, machine learning research in this area has been dramatically limited by the lack of large-scale resources. To address this, we introduce the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus, a new, freely available collection of labeled sentence pairs, written by humans doing a novel grounded task based on image captioning. At 570K pairs, it is two orders of magnitude larger than all other resources of its type. This increase in scale allows lexicalized classifiers to outperform some sophisticated existing entailment models, and it allows a neural network-based model to perform competitively on natural language inference benchmarks for the first time.

Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus, a collection of sentence pairs labeled for entailment, contradiction, and semantic independence.

We use this corpus to evaluate a variety of models for natural language inference, including rule-based systems, simple linear classifiers, and neural network-based models. We find that two models achieve comparable performance: a feature-rich classifier model and a neural network model centered around a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM).

Three models: neural network classifier based on one-layer model in Bowman

We demonstrate this possibility using an artificial data task for which recursive compositional structure is crucial, and find an LSTM-based sequence model can indeed learn to exploit the underlying tree structure. However, its performance consistently lags behind that of tree models, even on large training sets, suggesting that tree-structured models are more effective at exploiting recursive structure.},

In this paper, we summarize the LIDA model together with its resulting agent architecture, describe its computational implementation, and discuss results of simulations that replicate known experimental data. We also discuss some of LIDA's conceptual modules, propose nonlinear dynamics as a bridge between LIDA's modules and processes and the underlying neuroscience, and point out some of the differences between LIDA and other cognitive architectures.

  abstract = {This article reviews the 10-year history of tutor development based on the advanced computer tutoring theory (J. R. Anderson, 1983, 1993). We developed production system models in ACT of how students solved problems in LISP, geometry, and algebra. Computer tutors were developed around these cognitive models. Construction of these tutors was guided by a set of eight principles loosely based on the ACT theory. Early evaluations of these tutors usually, but not always, showed significant achievement gains. Best case evaluations showed that students could achieve at least the same level of proficiency as conventional instruction in one third of the time. Empirical studies showed that students were learning skills in production-rule units and that the best tutorial interaction style was one in which the tutor provides immediate feedback, consisting of short and directed error messages. The tutors appear to work better if they present themselves to students as nonhuman tools to assist learning rather than as emulations of human tutors. Students working with these tutors display transfer to other environments to the degree that they can map the tutor environment into the test environment. These experiences have coalesced into a new system for developing and deploying tutors. This system involves selecting a problem-solving interface, constructing a curriculum under the guidance of a domain expert, designing a cognitive model for solving problems in that environment, building instruction around the productions in that model, and deploying the tutor in the classroom. New tutors are being built in this system to achieve the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards for high-school mathematics in an urban setting.},

That is, it must be able to attribute mental states, including intentions, to other agents, and must use such attributions in its action selection process. The LIDA conceptual and computational model of cognition offers an explanation of how theory of mind is accomplished in humans and some other animals, and suggests how this explanation could be implemented computationally. Here we describe how the LIDA version of theory of mind is accomplished, and illustrate it with an example taken from an experiment with monkeys, chosen for simplicity.},

@article{demarneffe2015modeling,
  abstract = {A discourse typically involves numerous entities, but few are mentioned more than once. Distinguishing those that die out after just one mention (singleton) from those that lead longer lives (coreferent) would dramatically simplify the hypothesis space for coreference resolution models, leading to increased performance. To realize these gains, we build a classifier for predicting the singleton/coreferent distinction. The model's feature representations synthesize linguistic insights about the factors affecting discourse entity lifespans (especially negation, modality, and attitude predication) with existing results about the benefits of "surface" (part-of-speech and n-gram-based) features for coreference resolution. The model is effective in its own right, and the feature representations help to identify the anchor phrases in bridging anaphora as well. Furthermore, incorporating the model into two very different state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems, one rule-based and the other learning-based, yields significant performance improvements.},

@article{anderson1989skill,
  abstract = {An analysis of student learning with the LISP tutor indicates that while LISP is complex, learning it is simple. The key to factoring out the complexity of LISP is to monitor the learning of the 500 productions in the LISP tutor which describe the programming skill. The learning of these productions follows the power-law learning curve typical of skill acquisition. There is transfer from other programming experience to the extent that this programming experience involves the same productions. Subjects appear to differ only on the general dimensions of how well they acquire the productions and how well they retain the productions. Instructional manipulations such as remediation, content of feedback, and timing of feedback are effective to the extent they give students more practice programming, and explain to students why correct solutions work.},

@article{bekolay2014nengo,
  abstract = {Neuroscience currently lacks a comprehensive theory of how cognitive processes can be implemented in a biological substrate. The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered significant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the NEF. Nengo is a software tool that can be used to build and simulate large-scale models based on the NEF; currently, it is the primary resource for both teaching how the NEF is used, and for doing research that generates specific NEF models to explain experimental data. Nengo 1.4, which was implemented in Java, was used to create Spaun, the world's largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Simulating Spaun highlighted limitations in Nengo 1.4's ability to support model construction with simple syntax, to simulate large models quickly, and to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis. This paper describes Nengo 2.0, which is implemented in Python and overcomes these limitations. It uses simple and extendable syntax, simulates a benchmark model on the scale of Spaun 50 times faster than Nengo 1.4, and has a flexible mechanism for collecting simulation results.},

These units communicate in parallel via connections of varying strength that can be modified by experience. Connectionist networks have a wide range of theoretical and practical applications because they exhibit sophisticated, flexible, and context-sensitive behavior that mirrors human cognitive performance in many domains, from perception to language processing. By emphasizing the commonalities underlying various cognitive abilities, connectionism considers how a basic set of computational principles might give rise to many different forms of complex behavior. Thus connectionism supports a novel way of thinking about the nature and origins of mental life, as the emergent consequence of a system based around principles of parallel processing, distributed representation, and statistical learning that interacts with its environment over the course of development.},

A novel read and write scheme is designed to accelerate the training process, which realizes fully parallel operations of the weighted sum and the weight update. Furthermore, technology and design parameters of the resistive cross-point array are co-optimized to enhance the learning accuracy, latency and energy consumption, etc. In contrast to the conventional memory design, a set of reverse scaling rules is proposed on the resistive cross-point array to achieve high learning accuracy. These include 1) larger wire width to reduce the IR drop on interconnects thereby increasing the learning accuracy; 2) use of multiple cells for each weight element to alleviate the impact of the device variations, at an affordable expense of area, energy and latency. The optimized resistive cross-point array with peripheral circuitry is implemented at the 65 nm node. Its performance is benchmarked for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST database using gradient-based sparse coding. Compared to state-of-the-art software approach running on CPU, it achieves >10^3 speed-up and >10^6 energy efficiency improvement, enabling real-time image feature extraction and learning.},

@book{eliasmith2015build,
  abstract = {One goal of researchers in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence is to build theoretical models that can explain the flexibility and adaptiveness of biological systems. How to Build a Brain provides a guided exploration of a new cognitive architecture that takes biological detail seriously while addressing cognitive phenomena. The Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) introduced in this book provides a set of tools for constructing a wide range of biologically constrained perceptual, cognitive, and motor models.

Examples of such models are provided to explain a wide range of data including single-cell recordings, neural population activity, reaction times, error rates, choice behavior, and fMRI signals. Each of the models addressed in the book introduces a major feature of biological cognition, including semantics, syntax, control, learning, and memory. These models are presented as integrated considerations of brain function, giving rise to what is currently the world's largest functional brain model.

The book also compares the Semantic Pointer Architecture with the current state of the art, addressing issues of theory construction in the behavioral sciences, semantic compositionality, and scalability, among other considerations. The book concludes with a discussion of conceptual challenges raised by this architecture, and identifies several outstanding challenges for SPA and other cognitive architectures.

Along the way, the book considers neural coding, concept representation, neural dynamics, working memory, neuroanatomy, reinforcement learning, and spike-timing dependent plasticity. Eight detailed, hands-on tutorials exploiting the free Nengo neural simulation environment are also included, providing practical experience with the concepts and models presented throughout.

How to Build a Brain takes on a daunting task, focusing on those parts that we think are important for memory, attention, and planning. Previous attempts at building a cognitive architecture have used symbols or connectionist networks, but Eliasmith uses spiking neurons and models specific brain regions. Categories and semantics emerge from the architecture. The way that all these moving parts work together provides insights into both the nature of cognition and brain function.

Eliasmith offers a unified theory of cognition that rests on the mechanism of a semantic pointer, namely, a compressed neural representation that can stand as a symbol for a more detailed semantic state or be decompressed to reproduce it, in compositional cognitive processes. Ambitious state-of-the-art modeling grounds the semantic pointer architecture in populations of spiking neurons, providing concrete neural accounts of high-level processes, including attention, learning, memory, syntax, semantics, and reasoning. Along with offering a powerful new approach for integrating cognition and neuroscience, Eliasmith provides detailed technical accounts of his system, with accompanying software that will serve both students and fellow modelers well.},

@phdthesis{fielding2000architectural,
  abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

@article{hashmi2011neuromorphic,
  abstract = {The desire to create novel computing systems, paired with recent advances in neuroscientific understanding of the brain, has led researchers to develop neuromorphic architectures that emulate the brain. To date, such models are developed, trained, and deployed on the same substrate. However, excessive co-dependence between the substrate and the algorithm prevents portability, or at the very least requires reconstructing and retraining the model whenever the substrate changes. This paper proposes a well-defined abstraction layer -- the Neuromorphic instruction set architecture, or NISA -- that separates a neural application's algorithmic specification from the underlying execution substrate, and describes the Aivo framework, which demonstrates the concrete advantages of such an abstraction layer. Aivo consists of a NISA implementation for a rate-encoded neuromorphic system based on the cortical column abstraction, a state-of-the-art integrated development and runtime environment (IDE), and various profile-based optimization tools. Aivo's IDE generates code for emulating cortical networks on the host CPU, multiple GPGPUs, or as boolean functions. Its runtime system can deploy and adaptively optimize cortical networks in a manner similar to conventional just-in-time compilers in managed runtime systems (e.g. Java, C\#).

We demonstrate the abilities of the NISA abstraction by constructing a cortical network model of the mammalian visual cortex, deploying on multiple execution substrates, and utilizing the various optimization tools we have created. For this hierarchical configuration, Aivo's profiling based network optimization tools reduce the memory footprint by 50% and improve the execution time by a factor of 3x on the host CPU. Deploying the same network on a single GPGPU results in a 30x speedup. We further demonstrate that a speedup of 480x can be achieved by deploying a massively scaled cortical network across three GPGPUs. Finally, converting a trained hierarchical network to C/C++ boolean constructs on the host CPU results in 44x speedup.},

@article{hermann2014distributed,
  abstract = {The mathematical representation of semantics is a key issue for Natural Language Processing (NLP). A lot of research has been devoted to finding ways of representing the semantics of individual words in vector spaces. Distributional approaches --- meaning distributed representations that exploit co-occurrence statistics of large corpora --- have proved popular and successful across a number of tasks. However, natural language usually comes in structures beyond the word level, with meaning arising not only from the individual words but also the structure they are contained in at the phrasal or sentential level. Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is an equally fundamental task of NLP.

This dissertation explores methods for learning distributed semantic representations and models for composing these into representations for larger linguistic units. Our underlying hypothesis is that neural models are a suitable vehicle for learning semantically rich representations and that such representations in turn are suitable vehicles for solving important tasks in natural language processing. The contribution of this thesis is a thorough evaluation of our hypothesis, as part of which we introduce several new approaches to representation learning and compositional semantics, as well as multiple state-of-the-art models which apply distributed semantic representations to various tasks in NLP.},

  abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

Not everyone will agree on a single set of mechanisms that will explain the full range of human cognition, but such theories are within reach and we should strive to articulate them.

In this book, Newell makes the case for unified theories by setting forth a candidate. After reviewing the foundational concepts of cognitive science--knowledge, representation, computation, symbols, architecture, intelligence, and search--Newell introduces Soar, an architecture for general cognition. A pioneer system in artificial intelligence, Soar is the first problem solver to create its own subgoals and learn continuously from its own experience.

Newell shows how Soar's ability to operate within the real-time constraints of intelligent behavior, such as immediate-response and item-recognition tasks, illustrates important characteristics of the human cognitive structure. Throughout, Soar remains an exemplar: we know only enough to work toward a fully developed theory of cognition, but Soar's success so far establishes the viability of the enterprise.

Given its integrative approach, Unified Theories of Cognition will be of tremendous interest to researchers in a variety of fields, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and computer science. This exploration of the nature of mind, one of the great problems of philosophy, should also transcend disciplines and attract a large scientific audience.},

  abstract = {Cognitive Grammar considers the basic units of language to be symbols or conventional pairings of a semantic structure with a phonological label. Grammar consists of constraints on how these units can be combined to generate larger phrases which are also a pairing of semantics and phonology. The semantic aspects are modeled as image schemas rather than propositions, and because of the tight binding with the label, each can invoke the other.

  Like construction grammar (conceived by Charles Fillmore and further developed by Langacker's student Adele Goldberg), and unlike many mainstream linguistic theories, cognitive grammar extends the notion of symbolic units to the grammar of languages. Langacker further assumes that linguistic structures are motivated by general cognitive processes. In formulating his theory, he makes extensive use of principles of gestalt psychology and draws analogies between linguistic structure and aspects of visual perception.},

  abstract = {As the number of devices available per chip continues to increase, the computational potential of future computer architectures grows likewise. While this is a clear benefit for future computing devices, future chips will also likely suffer from more faulty devices and increased power consumption. It is also likely that these chips will be difficult to program if the current trend of adding more parallel cores continues to follow in the future. However, recent advances in neuroscientific understanding make parallel computing devices modeled after the human neocortex a plausible, attractive, fault-tolerant, and energy-efficient possibility.

In this paper we describe a GPGPU extension to an intelligent model based on the mammalian neocortex. The GPGPU is a readily-available architecture that fits well with the parallel cortical architecture inspired by the basic building blocks of the human brain. Using NVIDIA's CUDA framework, we have achieved up to 273x speedup over our unoptimized C++ serial implementation. We also consider two inefficiencies inherent to our initial design: multiple kernel-launch overhead and poor utilization of GPGPU resources. We propose using a software work-queue structure to solve the former, and pipelining the cortical architecture during training phase for the latter. Additionally, from our success in extending our model to the GPU, we speculate the necessary hardware requirements for simulating the computational abilities of mammalian brains.},

Offering a comprehensive account of the role of the cerebral cortex in perception, this monumental work by one of the world's greatest living neuroscientists does nothing short of creating a new subdiscipline in the field: perceptual neuroscience.

For this undertaking, Vernon Mountcastle has gathered information from a vast number of sources reaching back through two centuries of investigation into the intrinsic operations of the cortex. His survey includes phylogenetic, comparative, and neuroanatomical studies of the neocortex; studies of the large-scale organization of the neocortex, of neuronal histogenesis and the specification of cortical areas, of synaptic transmission between neurons in cortical microcircuits, and of rhythmicity and synchronization in neocortical networks; and inquiries into the binding problem‚Äîhow activities among the separate processing nodes of distributed systems coalesce in a coherent activity that we call perception.

The first book to summarize what is known about the physiology of the cortex in perception, Perceptual Neuroscience will be a landmark in the literature of neuroscience.},

We identify several essential capabilities and characteristics of architectures needed for such robots to develop high levels of autonomy, in particular, modular and asynchronous processing, specialised representations, relational reasoning, mechanisms to translate between representations, and multiple types of integrated learning. We demonstrate an implemented Mala system and evaluate its performance on a challenging autonomous robotic urban search and rescue task. We then discuss the various types of learning required for rich and extended autonomy, and how the structure of the proposed architecture enables each type. We conclude by discussing the relationship of the system to previous work and its potential for developing robots capable of long-term autonomy.},

However, there are two felicitous usage patterns in which the speaker violates this preference in part to convey information about the language itself. First, disjunctions of terms in a one-way semantic inclusion relation, such as boat or canoe, can form part of a speaker strategy to manage lexical uncertainty surrounding the two terms, or block unwanted implicatures that the listener might draw from the general term alone. Second, disjunctions of synonymous terms like wine lover or oenophile can be used to convey definitional information. We explore both of these uses, relying on corpora to obtain a fuller picture of their motivations and their effects on the listener. In addition, we show how both these uses are predicted by a standard semantics for disjunction and a recursive probabilistic model of communication in which speakers and listeners simultaneously exchange information about the world and about the language they are using. We also use the model to begin to formally characterize the pragmatics of implicature cancelation or blocking.},

Large scale versions of these models have the potential for significantly stronger inference capabilities than current conventional computing systems. These models have large amounts of parallelism and simple computations, thus allowing highly efficient hardware implementations. As a result, hardware-acceleration of these models can produce significant speedups over fully software implementations. Parallel software and hardware-accelerated implementations of such a model are investigated for networks of varying complexity.

Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are "metaphors we live by"-metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them.

In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.},

  abstract = {I-Language introduces the uninitiated to linguistics as cognitive science. In an engaging, down-to-earth style Daniela Isac and Charles Reiss give a crystal-clear demonstration of the application of the scientific method in linguistic theory. Their presentation of the research program inspired by Noam Chomsky shows how the focus of theory and research in linguistics shifted from treating language as a disembodied, human-external entity to cognitive biolinguistics - the study of language as a human cognitive system embedded within the mind/brain of each individual. The recurring theme of equivalence classes in linguistic computation ties together the presentation of material from phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. The same theme is used to help students understand the place of linguistics in the broader context of the cognitive sciences, by drawing on examples from vision, audition and even animal cognition.

This textbook is unique in its integration of empirical issues of linguistic analysis, engagement with philosophical questions that arise in the study of language, and treatment of the history of the field. Topics ranging from allophony to reduplication, ergativity, and negative polarity are invoked to show the implications of findings in cognitive biolinguistics for philosophical issues like reference, the mind-body problem, and nature-nurture debates.},

Since then, we have seen several notable corpora that are about 100 times larger, and in 2006, Google released a trillion-word corpus with frequency counts for all sequences up to five words long. In some ways this corpus is a step backwards from the Brown Corpus: it's taken from unfiltered Web pages and thus contains incomplete sentences, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and all sorts of other errors. It's not annotated with carefully hand-corrected part-of-speech tags. But the fact that it's a million times larger than the Brown Corpus outweighs these drawbacks. A trillion-word corpus - along with other Web-derived corpora of millions, billions, or trillions of links, videos, images, tables, and user interactions - captures even very rare aspects of human behavior. So, this corpus could serve as the basis of a complete model for certain tasks - if only we knew how to extract the model from the data.},

@article{stewart2012neural,
  abstract = {The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is a general methodology that allows the building of large-scale, biologically plausible, neural models of cognition. The NEF acts as a neural compiler: once the properties of the neurons, the values to be represented, and the functions to be computed are specified, it solves for the connection weights between components that will perform the desired functions. Importantly, this works not only for feed-forward computations, but also for recurrent connections, allowing for complex dynamical systems including integrators, oscillators, Kalman filters, etc. The NEF also incorporates realistic local error-driven learning rules, allowing for the online adaptation and optimisation of responses. The NEF has been used to model visual attention, inductive reasoning, reinforcement learning and many other tasks. Recently, we used it to build Spaun, the world{\textquoteright}s largest functional brain model, using 2.5 million neurons to perform eight different cognitive tasks by interpreting visual input and producing hand-written output via a simulated 6-muscle arm.  Our open-source software Nengo was used for all of these, and is available at http://nengo.ca, along with tutorials, demos, and downloadable models.},

  abstract = {Learning effective feature representations and similarity measures are crucial to the retrieval performance of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system. Despite extensive research efforts for decades, it remains one of the most challenging open problems that considerably hinders the successes of real-world CBIR systems. The key challenge has been attributed to the well-known ``semantic gap'' issue that exists between low-level image pixels captured by machines and high-level semantic concepts perceived by human. Among various techniques, machine learning has been actively investigated as a possible direction to bridge the semantic gap in the long term. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for computer vision and other applications, in this paper, we attempt to address an open problem: if deep learning is a hope for bridging the semantic gap in CBIR and how much improvements in CBIR tasks can be achieved by exploring the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for learning feature representations and similarity measures. Specifically, we investigate a framework of deep learning with application to CBIR tasks with an extensive set of empirical studies by examining a state-of-the-art deep learning method (Convolutional Neural Networks) for CBIR tasks under varied settings. From our empirical studies, we find some encouraging results and summarize some important insights for future research.},

@book{pinker2011words,
  abstract = {simple concepts we use to devise works as complex as love sonnets and tax laws. his linguistic research suggests that each of us stores a limited (though large) number of words and word-parts in memory and manipulates them with a much smaller number of rules to produce every writing and utterance.

  critique: If The Language Instinct described Pinker's view of the development of language and How the Mind Works described his views about cognition in general, this latest work details his ideas about the cognitive organization of language. And like his other books, Pinker tries to persuade the reader to agree with his assessment of thingsusing humorous examples, occasionally odd logic, hyperbole, and in this case a 290 page extended example.

Pinker believes that the brain's representation of language is rule based - morphology (such as adding -s to a noun to make it plural or -ed to a verb to make it past tense) occurs because a system in the brain applies a rule during language production. During the past twenty years or so, many cognitive scientists have begun to think that perhaps this type of morphology is not rule based at all, but instead occurs because of the specific pattern of connections in the brain. The goal of this book is to convince the reader that connectionism is wrong, and a rule based system is correct. To do this, he talks about irregular verbs; their etymology bastardization by children, idiosyncrasies, and production by non-typical populations. I never thought that irregular verbs and oddly plauralized nouns could be interesting. I was right. This topic is so much more esoteric than his other books, that even his entertaining examples could not overcome either my skepticism or my boredom. After a while you just want to hear something different. Pinker is not reporting a phenomena, and evenhandedly evaluating various explanatory theories; he is presenting one view to be dismantled, and another to be exalted as correct. But giving selective evidence could bias his readers towards his view, and I am not convinced I was given a chance to really evaluate the competing theories. I anxiously await the rebuttal by the connectionist school.

If you have read Pinker's popular books before, I can only say that this book is not at the same level. Its scope is much narrower, and its subject matter a bit more technical. That being said, if you love Pinker's way of presenting material, you will not be disappointed. If you haven't read Pinker before, I recommend that you start with one of his other books - they truly live up to their reputations.},

Our chief insight is that while the space of images is effectively infinite, the space of semantically differentiable scenes is actually not that large. For many image completion tasks we are able to find similar scenes which contain image fragments that will convincingly complete the image. Our algorithm is entirely data-driven, requiring no annotations or labeling by the user. Unlike existing image completion methods, our algorithm can generate a diverse set of results for each input image and we allow users to select among them. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing image completion approaches.},

@article{matsuda2013cognitive,
  abstract = {This paper describes an advanced learning technology used to investigate hypotheses about learning by teaching. The proposed technology is an instance of a teachable agent, called SimStudent, that learns skills (e.g., for solving linear equations) from examples and from feedback on performance. SimStudent has been integrated into an on-line, game-like environment in which students act as ‚Äútutors‚Äù and can interactively teach SimStudent by providing it with examples and feedback. We conducted three classroom ‚Äúin vivo‚Äù studies to better understand how and when students learn (or fail to learn) by teaching. One of the strengths of interactive technologies is their ability to collect detailed process data on the nature and timing of student activities. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis across three studies to understand the underlying cognitive and social factors that contribute to tutor learning by making connections between outcome and process data. The results show several key cognitive and social factors that are correlated with tutor learning. The accuracy of students‚Äô responses (i.e., feedback and hints), the quality of students‚Äô explanations during tutoring, and the appropriateness of tutoring strategy (i.e., problem selection) all positively affected SimStudent‚Äôs learning, which further positively affected students‚Äô learning. The results suggest that implementing adaptive help for students on how to tutor and solve problems is a crucial component for successful learning by teaching.},

@book{vernon2014artificial,
  abstract = {This book offers a concise and accessible introduction to the emerging field of artificial cognitive systems. Cognition, both natural and artificial, is about anticipating the need for action and developing the capacity to predict the outcome of those actions. Drawing on artificial intelligence, developmental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience, the field of artificial cognitive systems has as its ultimate goal the creation of computer-based systems that can interact with humans and serve society in a variety of ways. This primer brings together recent work in cognitive science and cognitive robotics to offer readers a solid grounding on key issues.

The book first develops a working definition of cognitive systems -- broad enough to encompass multiple views of the subject and deep enough to help in the formulation of theories and models. It surveys the cognitivist, emergent, and hybrid paradigms of cognitive science and discusses cognitive architectures derived from them. It then turns to the key issues, with chapters devoted to autonomy, embodiment, learning and development, memory and prospection, knowledge and representation, and social cognition. Ideas are introduced in an intuitive, natural order, with an emphasis on the relationships among ideas and building to an overview of the field. The main text is straightforward and succinct; sidenotes drill deeper on specific topics and provide contextual links to further reading.},

@misc{harnard2003symbol,

How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) "iconic representations," which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) "categorical representations," which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations," grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., "An X is a Y that is Z").},

This review presents a simple discriminative learning framework for defining such models and relating them to logical theories. Within this framework, we discuss the task of learning to map utterances to logical forms (semantic parsing) and the task of learning from denotations with logical forms as latent variables. We also consider models that use distributed (e.g., vector) representations rather than logical ones, showing that these can be considered part of the same overall framework for understanding meaning and structural complexity.},

Two learning algorithms are proposed and compared to learn the bi-manual skill: one with Expectation-Maximization based Reinforcement Learning, and one with chained vector regression called the ARCHER algorithm. Both algorithms are used to modulate and coordinate the motion of the two hands, while an inverse kinematics controller is used for the motion of the arms. The image processing part recognizes where the arrow hits the target and is based on Gaussian Mixture Models for color-based detection of the target and the arrow's tip.

@article{kim2015reconfigurable,
  abstract = {This article presents a brain-inspired reconfigurable digital neuromorphic processor (DNP) architecture for large-scale spiking neural networks. The proposed architecture integrates an arbitrary number of N digital leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) silicon neurons to mimic their biological counterparts and on-chip learning circuits to realize spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules. We leverage memristor nanodevices to build an N√óN crossbar array to store not only multibit synaptic weight values but also network configuration data with significantly reduced area overhead. Additionally, the crossbar array is designed to be accessible both column- and row-wise to expedite the synaptic weight update process for learning. The proposed digital pulse width modulator (PWM) produces binary pulses with various durations for reading and writing the multilevel memristive crossbar. The proposed column based analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) scheme efficiently accumulates the presynaptic weights of each neuron and reduces silicon area overhead by using a shared arithmetic unit to process the LIF operations of all N neurons. With 256 silicon neurons, learning circuits and 64K synapses, the power dissipation and area of our DNP are 6.45 mW and 1.86 mm2, respectively, when implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The functionality of the proposed DNP architecture is demonstrated by realizing an unsupervised-learning based character recognition system.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‚Äòvalue networks‚Äô to evaluate board positions and ‚Äòpolicy networks‚Äô to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

This means that general executive control strategies have to be implemented for each specific model, which means a lack of consistency and constraint. Alternatively, they are implemented as part of the architecture itself, which is often implausible, because strategies are learned and differ among individuals. The alternative is to assume executive control consists of strategies that can transfer from one task to another. The PRIMs theory (Taatgen 2013) provides a modeling framework for this transfer. The approach is discussed using the example of working memory control.},

Critical to the success of this project has been a client-centered design approach that has matched our client's expertise in curricular objectives and classroom teaching with our expertise in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. The Pittsburgh Urban Mathematics Project (PUMP) has produced an algebra curriculum that is centrally focused on mathematical analysis of real world situations and the use of computational tools. We have built an intelligent tutor, called PAT, that supports this curriculum and has been made a regular part of 9th grade Algebra in 3 Pittsburgh schools. In the 1993-94 school year, we evaluated the effect of the PUMP curriculum and PAT tutor use. On average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15% on standardized tests and 100% on tests targeting the PUMP objectives. This study provides further evidence that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools.},

  abstract = {Cognitive computing and cognitive technologies are game changers for future engineering systems, as well as for engineering practice and training. They are major drivers for knowledge automation work, and the creation of cognitive products with higher levels of intelligence than current smart products. This paper gives a brief review of cognitive computing and some of the cognitive engineering systems activities. The potential of cognitive technologies is outlined, along with a brief description of future cognitive environments, incorporating cognitive assistants - specialized proactive intelligent software agents designed to follow and interact with humans and other cognitive assistants across the environments. The cognitive assistants engage, individually or collectively, with humans through a combination of adaptive multimodal interfaces, and advanced visualization and navigation techniques. The realization of future cognitive environments requires the development of a cognitive innovation ecosystem for the engineering workforce. The continuously expanding major components of the ecosystem include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities (incorporating predictive and prescriptive big data analytics); novel cognitive modeling and visual simulation facilities; cognitive multimodal interfaces; and cognitive mobile and wearable devices. The ecosystem will provide timely, engaging, personalized / collaborative, learning and effective decision making. It will stimulate creativity and innovation, and prepare the participants to work in future cognitive enterprises and develop new cognitive products of increasing complexity.},

  abstract = {Current research on Internet of Things (IoT) mainly focuses on how to enable general objects to see, hear, and smell the physical world for themselves, and make them connected to share the observations. In this paper, we argue that only connected is not enough, beyond that, general objects should have the capability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds by themselves. This practical need impels us to develop a new paradigm, named Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT), to empower the current IoT with a `brain' for high-level intelligence. Specifically, we first present a comprehensive definition for CIoT, primarily inspired by the effectiveness of human cognition. Then, we propose an operational framework of CIoT, which mainly characterizes the interactions among five fundamental cognitive tasks: perception-action cycle, massive data analytics, semantic derivation and knowledge discovery, intelligent decision-making, and on-demand service provisioning. Furthermore, we provide a systematic tutorial on key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks. In addition, we also discuss the design of proper performance metrics on evaluating the enabling techniques. Last but not least, we present the research challenges and open issues ahead. Building on the present work and potentially fruitful future studies, CIoT has the capability to bridge the physical world (with objects, resources, etc.) and the social world (with human demand, social behavior, etc.), and enhance smart resource allocation, automatic network operation, and intelligent service provisioning.},

Techniques of automated reasoning allow a computer system to draw conclusions from knowledge represented in a machine-interpretable form. Recently, ontologies have evolved in computer science as computational artefacts to provide computer systems with a conceptual yet computational model of a particular domain of interest. In this way, computer systems can base decisions on reasoning about domain knowledge, similar to humans. This chapter gives an overview on basic knowledge representation aspects and on ontologies as used within computer systems. After introducing ontologies in terms of their appearance, usage and classification, it addresses concrete ontology languages that are particularly important in the context of the Semantic Web. The most recent and predominant ontology languages and formalisms are presented in relation to each other and a selection of them is discussed in more detail.},

In each case, we describe the neural network architectures and training rules and provide a statistical commentary. The topics treated in this way are perceptrons (from single-unit to multilayer versions), Hopfield-type recurrent networks (including probabilistic versions strongly related to statistical physics and Gibbs distributions) and associative memory networks trained by so-called unsuperviszd learning rules. Perceptrons are shown to have strong associations with discriminant analysis and regression, and unsupervised networks with cluster analysis.

Normative questions include whether human thinking should be Bayesian, whether decision making should maximize expected utility, and how norms should be established.

A variety of named entity disambiguation methods have been proposed, but most of them focus on Wikipedia as a sole knowledge resource. This focus does not fit all application scenarios, and customization to the respective application domain is crucial. This dissertation addresses the problem of building an easily customizable system for named entity disambiguation. The first contribution is the development of a universal and flexible architecture that supports plugging in different knowledge resources. The second contribution is utilizing the flexible architecture to develop two domain-specific disambiguation systems. The third contribution is the design of a complete pipeline for building disambiguation systems for languages other than English that have poor annotated resources such as Arabic. The fourth contribution is a novel approach that performs fine-grained type classification of names in natural language text.},

@article{williams2016brain,
  abstract = {Efficiently allocating shared resources in computer systems is critical to optimizing execution. Recently, a number of market-based solutions have been proposed to attack this problem. Some of them provide provable theoretical bounds to efficiency and/or fairness losses under market equilibrium. However, they are limited to markets with potentially important constraints, such as enforcing equal budget for all players, or curve-fitting players' utility into a specific function type. Moreover, they do not generally provide an intuitive "knob" to control efficiency vs. fairness. In this paper, we introduce two new metrics, Market Utility Range (MUR) and Market Budget Range (MBR), through which we provide for the first time theoretical bounds on efficiency and fairness of market equilibria under arbitrary budget assignments. We leverage this result and propose ReBudget, an iterative budget re-assignment algorithm that can be used to control efficiency vs. fairness at run-time. We apply our algorithm to a multi-resource allocation problem in multicore chips. Our evaluation using detailed execution-driven simulations shows that our budget re-assignment technique is intuitive, effective, and efficient. To protect existing systems from more advanced rowhammer attacks, we develop a software-based defense, ANVIL, which thwarts all known rowhammer attacks on existing systems. ANVIL detects rowhammer attacks by tracking the locality of DRAM accesses using existing hardware performance counters. Our detector identifies the rows being frequently accessed (i.e., the aggressors), then selectively refreshes the nearby victim rows to prevent hammering. Experiments running on real hardware with the SPEC2006 benchmarks show that ANVIL has less than a 1% false positive rate and an average slowdown of 1%. ANVIL is low-cost and robust, and our experiments indicate that it is an effective approach for protecting existing and future systems from even advanced rowhammer attacks. This paper proposes a novel architecture that breaks the serialization of hardware queues and enables the queued processors to perform lock-free synchronization in parallel. The architecture, called CASPAR, is able to (1) execute the CASes in the queued-up processors in parallel through eager forwarding of expected values, and (2) validate the CASes in parallel and dequeue groups of processors at a time. The result is highly-scalable synchronization. We evaluate CASPAR with simulations of a 64-core chip. Compared to existing proposals with hardware queues, CASPAR improves the throughput of kernels by 32% on average, and reduces the execution time of the sections considered in lock-free versions of applications by 47% on average. This makes these sections 2.5x faster than in the original applications.},

Cognitive robotics is an approach to creating artificial intelligence in robots by enabling them to learn from and respond to real-world situations, as opposed to pre-programming the robot with specific responses to every conceivable stimulus. Presenting the contributions of international experts from various disciplines within the field, Cognitive Robotics provides novel material and discusses advanced approaches in the field of intelligent robotics. It explains the various aspects of the topic to provide readers with a solid foundation on the subject. This edited collection presents theoretical research in cognitive robotics. It takes a multidisciplinary approach that considers the artificial intelligence, physical, chemical, philosophical, psychological, social, cultural, and ethical aspects of this rapidly emerging field. The editor is a prominent researcher whose Lovotics research into emotional bonds with robots is widely recognized. Supplying an accessible introduction to cognitive robotics, the book considers computational intelligence for cognitive robotics based on informationally structured space. It examines how people respond to robots and what makes robots psychologically appealing to humans. The book contextualizes concepts in the history of studies on intelligence theories and includes case studies of different types of robots in action. Although ideal for robotics researchers and professionals, this book is also suitable for use as a supporting textbook in advanced robotics courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of statistical data analysis in enterprise applications has created an arms race among database vendors to offer ever more sophisticated in-database analytics. One challenge in this race is that each new statistical technique must be implemented from scratch in the RDBMS, which leads to a lengthy and complex development process. We argue that the root cause for this overhead is the lack of a unified architecture for in-database analytics. Our main contribution in this work is to take a step towards such a unified architecture. A key benefit of our unified architecture is that performance optimizations for analytics techniques can be studied generically instead of an ad hoc, per-technique fashion. In particular, our technical contributions are theoretical and empirical studies of two key factors that we found impact performance: the order data is stored, and parallelization of computations on a single-node multicore RDBMS. We demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture by integrating several popular analytics techniques into two commercial and one open-source RDBMS. Our architecture requires changes to only a few dozen lines of code to integrate a new statistical technique. We then compare our approach with the native analytics tools offered by the commercial RDBMSes on various analytics tasks, and validate that our approach achieves competitive or higher performance, while still achieving the same quality.},

We propose methods to generate a sample of representative microposts by discovering tweets that are likely to refer to new entities. Our approach is able to significantly speed-up the semantic analysis process by discarding retweets, tweets without pre-identifiable entities, as well similar and redundant tweets, while retaining information content.

We apply the approach on a corpus of 1:4 billion microposts, using the IE services of AlchemyAPI, Calais, and Zemanta to identify more than 700,000 unique entities. For the evaluation we compare runtime and number of entities extracted based on the full and the downscaled version of a micropost set. We are able to demonstrate that for datasets of more than 10 million tweets we can achieve a reduction in size of more than 80% while maintaining up to 60% coverage on unique entities cumulatively discovered by the three IE tools.

We publish the resulting Twitter metadata as Linked Data using SIOC and an extension of the NERD core ontology.},

First, expensive big data transfer cost must be paid up front to move data between databases and analytics systems. Second, many popular text analytics packages do not scale up to production sized datasets. In this paper, we introduce GPText, Greenplum parallel statistical text analysis framework that addresses the above problems by supporting statistical inference and learning algorithms natively in a massively parallel processing database system. GPText seamlessly integrates the Solr search engine and applies statistical algorithms such as k-means and LDA using MADLib, an open source library for scalable in-database analytics which can be installed on Post-greSQL and Greenplum. In addition, GPText also developed and contributed a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) module to MADLib to enable information extraction tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. We show the performance and scalability of the parallel CRF implementation. Finally, we describe an eDiscovery application built on the GPText framework.},

@article{hellerstein2012madlib,
  abstract = {MADlib is a free, open-source library of in-database analytic methods. It provides an evolving suite of SQL-based algorithms for machine learning, data mining and statistics that run at scale within a database engine, with no need for data import/export to other tools. The goal is for MADlib to eventually serve a role for scalable database systems that is similar to the CRAN library for R: a community repository of statistical methods, this time written with scale and parallelism in mind.

In this paper we introduce the MADlib project, including the background that led to its beginnings, and the motivation for its open-source nature. We provide an overview of the library's architecture and design patterns, and provide a description of various statistical methods in that context. We include performance and speedup results of a core design pattern from one of those methods over the Greenplum parallel DBMS on a modest-sized test cluster. We then report on two initial efforts at incorporating academic research into MADlib, which is one of the project's goals.

MADlib is freely available at http://madlib.net, and the project is open for contributions of both new methods, and ports to additional database platforms.},

@techreport{stodder2014eight,
  abstract = {Organizations that aspire to be data driven cannot afford to limit users‚Äô data analysis to structured data: that is, the alphanumeric data types that have been carefully defined, modeled, and stored in standard spreadsheets, relational databases, and data warehouses. In the course of business processes, operations, and customer interactions, enterprises generate far more than just structured data‚Äîin particular, most are swimming in massive amounts of text.


Drawn from both internal and external sources, text files form a potential gold mine of insights that could help organizations reduce costs, improve customer relationships, speed response to events, and innovate with products and services. Business intelligence (BI) and data warehousing (DW) systems are adept at delivering the numbers, but if users do not have access to unstructured and semi-structured text such as customer comments, field personnel notes, and social media, they will be blind to contextual information that could help answer questions about the numbers. Exploratory analysis of text could reveal emerging trends that do not show up in BI reports.


Text analytics covers a range of technologies and practices for analyzing text, extracting relevant information, and transforming sources by applying structure so that analysis can be repeated and adjusted over time. Software solutions combine techniques from natural language processing, statistics, and machine learning. One of the goals of text analytics is to accurately extract entities, facts, concepts, themes, and sentiment. With the popularity of social media, many enterprises are interested in performing sentiment analysis. However, interest is expanding across industries to other uses, such as in healthcare, where text analytics helps doctors understand the full context of patient symptoms and engage in evidence-based medicine.


Making use of modern data visualization, text analytics solutions enable users to explore text on desktops and mobile devices. Business users, not just specialized text analysts, can use the solutions to derive value‚Äîfor example, by aggregating findings from text with their analysis of structured data. Following TDWI‚Äôs previous Checklist Report on this topic, How to Gain Insight from Text, this Checklist discusses the relevance of text analytics for improving user experiences with the semi-structured and unstructured textual big data now at their disposal.},

@article{goodfellow2014multidigit,
  abstract = {Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over 96% accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving 97.84% accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over 90% accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a 99.8% accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.},

@article{pfurtscheller2010hybrid,
  abstract = {Nowadays, everybody knows what a hybrid car is. A hybrid car normally has two engines to enhance energy efficiency and reduce CO2 output. Similarly, a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) is composed of two BCIs, or at least one BCI and another system. A hybrid BCI, like any BCI, must fulfill the following four criteria: (i) the device must rely on signals recorded directly from the brain; (ii) there must be at least one recordable brain signal that the user can intentionally modulate to effect goal-directed behaviour; (iii) real time processing; and (iv) the user must obtain feedback. This paper introduces hybrid BCIs that have already been published or are in development. We also introduce concepts for future work. We describe BCIs that classify two EEG patterns: one is the event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD, ERS) of sensorimotor rhythms, and the other is the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Hybrid BCIs can either process their inputs simultaneously, or operate two systems sequentially, where the first system can act as a ‚Äúbrain switch‚Äù. For example, we describe a hybrid BCI that simultaneously combines ERD and SSVEP BCIs. We also describe a sequential hybrid BCI, in which subjects could use a brain switch to control an SSVEP-based hand orthosis. Subjects who used this hybrid BCI exhibited about half the false positives encountered while using the SSVEP BCI alone. A brain switch can also rely on hemodynamic changes measured through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Hybrid BCIs can also use one brain signal and a different type of input. This additional input can be an electrophysiological signal such as the heart rate, or a signal from an external device such as an eye tracking system.},

Implementing the vision of the Semantic Web thus requires transforming this unstructured data into structured data. One key step during this process is the recognition of named entities. Previous works suggest that ensemble learning can be used to improve the performance of named entity recognition tools. However, no comparison of the performance of existing supervised machine learning approaches on this task has been presented so far. We address this research gap by presenting a thorough evaluation of named entity recognition based on ensemble learning. To this end, we combine four different state-of-the approaches by using 15 different algorithms for ensemble learning and evaluate their performance on five different datasets. Our results suggest that ensemble learning can reduce the error rate of state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems by 40\%, thereby leading to over 95\% f-score in our best run.},

Within IBM, the computerization of informational systems is progressing, driven by business needs and by the availability of improved tools for accessing the company data. It is now apparent that an architecture is needed to draw together the various strands of informational system activity within the company. IBM Europe, Middle East, and Africa (E/ME/A) has adopted an architecture called the E/ME/A Business Information System (EBIS) architecture as the strategic direction for informational systems. EBIS proposes an integrated warehouse of company data based firmly in the relational database environment. End-user access to this warehouse is simplified by a consistent set of tools provided by an end-user interface and supported by a business data directory that describes the information available in user terms.

@book{bostorm2016superintelligence,
  abstract = {The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains.

If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.

But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?

To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence.

This profoundly ambitious and original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.},

  abstract = {Algorithms increasingly run our lives. They find books, movies, jobs, and dates for us, manage our investments, and discover new drugs. More and more, these algorithms work by learning from the trails of data we leave in our newly digital world. Like curious children, they observe us, imitate, and experiment. And in the world‚Äôs top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything we want, before we even ask.

Machine learning is the automation of discovery‚Äîthe scientific method on steroids‚Äîthat enables intelligent robots and computers to program themselves. No field of science today is more important yet more shrouded in mystery. Pedro Domingos, one of the field‚Äôs leading lights, lifts the veil for the first time to give us a peek inside the learning machines that power Google, Amazon, and your smartphone. He charts a course through machine learning‚Äôs five major schools of thought, showing how they turn ideas from neuroscience, evolution, psychology, physics, and statistics into algorithms ready to serve you. Step by step, he assembles a blueprint for the future universal learner‚Äîthe Master Algorithm‚Äîand discusses what it means for you, and for the future of business, science, and society.

If data-ism is today‚Äôs rising philosophy, this book will be its bible. The quest for universal learning is one of the most significant, fascinating, and revolutionary intellectual developments of all time. A groundbreaking book, The Master Algorithm is the essential guide for anyone and everyone wanting to understand not just how the revolution will happen, but how to be at its forefront.

@book{ellenberg2015wrong,
  abstract = {Overview:  The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned.  In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is:  Math isn't confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do-the whole world is shot through with it.  Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world.  It's a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument.  Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted:  How early should you get to the airport?  What does "public opinion" really represent?  Why do tall parents have shorter children?  Who really won Florida in 2000?  And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer?  How Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician's method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman-minus the jargon.  Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia's views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can't figure out about you, and the existence of God.  Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need.  Math, as Ellenberg says, is "an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength."  With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. How Not to Be Wrong will show you how.},

  abstract = {Assistive technologies predominantly employ devices such as virtual keyboards and wheelchair controllers to enable handicapped individuals to interact with their environment. In the absence of assistive devices, a handicapped individual's only recourse is to rely on an attendant for assistance in performing daily activities. Assistive technologies therefore enable disabled person to regain a measure of independence. However, the state-of-the-art assistive technologies are limited in their abilities. There has been limited work on assistive writing agents.

A previous study investigated robot-based writing using a 5-axis industrial robot [8]. This paper investigates the feasibility of a robot-based writing agent using a lower capability3-axis device. This work is en route to the interfacing to a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for BCI-controlled robot writing. A full alphanumerical English character set was developed and implemented using the system. The generated characters were legible. Minor errors were evident in trajectory execution due to controller transience and frayed marker tips. However, these errors do not significantly demerit the legibility of the characters.The 3-axis robot was therefore able to generate legible text like the previous study [8] but with a lower capability device.},

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

@book{koller2009probabilistic,
  abstract = {Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason -- to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.

Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

SVMProt classification system is trained from representative proteins of a number of functional families and seed proteins of Pfam curated protein families. It currently covers 54 functional families and additional families will be added in the near future. The computed accuracy for protein family classification is found to be in the range of 69.1‚Äì99.6\%. SVMProt shows a certain degree of capability for the classification of distantly related proteins and homologous proteins of different function and thus may be used as a protein function prediction tool that complements sequence alignment methods.

Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

@book{harispe2015semantic,
  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence federates numerous scientific fields in the aim of developing machines able to assist human operators performing complex treatments.most of which demand high cognitive skills (e.g. learning or decision processes). Central to this quest is to give machines the ability to estimate the likeness or similarity between things in the way human beings estimate the similarity between stimuli. In this context, this book focuses on semantic measures: approaches designed for comparing semantic entities such as units of language, e.g. words, sentences, or concepts and instances defined into knowledge bases. The aim of these measures is to assess the similarity or relatedness of such semantic entities by taking into account their semantics, i.e. their meaning.intuitively, the words tea and coffee, which both refer to stimulating beverage, will be estimated to be more semantically similar than the words toffee (confection) and coffee, despite that the last pair has a higher syntactic similarity. The two state-of-the-art approaches for estimating and quantifying semantic similarities/relatedness of semantic entities are presented in detail: the first one relies on corpora analysis and is based on Natural Language Processing techniques and semantic models while the second is based on more or less formal, computer-readable and workable forms of knowledge such as semantic networks, thesauri or ontologies. Semantic measures are widely used today to compare units of language, concepts, instances or even resources indexed by them (e.g., documents, genes). They are central elements of a large variety of Natural Language Processing applications and knowledge-based treatments, and have therefore naturally been subject to intensive and interdisciplinary research efforts during last decades. Beyond a simple inventory and categorization of existing measures, the aim of this monograph is to convey novices as well as researchers of these domains toward a better understanding of semantic similarity estimation and more generally semantic measures. To this end, we propose an in-depth characterization of existing proposals by discussing their features, the assumptions on which they are based and empirical results regarding their performance in particular applications. By answering these questions and by providing a detailed discussion on the foundations of semantic measures, our aim is to give the reader key knowledge required to: (i) select the more relevant methods according to a particular usage context, (ii) understand the challenges offered to this field of study, (iii) distinguish room of improvements for state-of-the-art approaches and (iv) stimulate creativity toward the development of new approaches. In this aim, several definitions, theoretical and practical details, as well as concrete applications are presented.},

@article{palmer2010semantic,
  abstract = {This book is aimed at providing an overview of several aspects of semantic role labeling. Chapter 1 begins with linguistic background on the definition of semantic roles and the controversies surrounding them. Chapter 2 describes how the theories have led to structured lexicons such as FrameNet, VerbNet and the PropBank Frame Files that in turn provide the basis for large scale semantic annotation of corpora. This data has facilitated the development of automatic semantic role labeling systems based on supervised machine learning techniques. Chapter 3 presents the general principles of applying both supervised and unsupervised machine learning to this task, with a description of the standard stages and feature choices, as well as giving details of several specific systems. Recent advances include the use of joint inference to take advantage of context sensitivities, and attempts to improve performance by closer integration of the syntactic parsing task with semantic role labeling. Chapter 3 also discusses the impact the granularity of the semantic roles has on system performance. Having outlined the basic approach with respect to English, Chapter 4 goes on to discuss applying the same techniques to other languages, using Chinese as the primary example. Although substantial training data is available for Chinese, this is not the case for many other languages, and techniques for projecting English role labels onto parallel corpora are also presented.},

Digital technologies -- with hardware, software, and networks at their core -- will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee -- two thinkers at the forefront of their field -- reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds, from lawyers to truck drivers, will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress. - Publisher. This book takes a look into the future of business, work, and the economy in a digital world. In recent years, computers have learned to diagnose diseases, drive cars, and win at Jeopardy!.

@book{zhu2009introduction,
  abstract = {Semi-supervised learning is a learning paradigm concerned with the study of how computers and natural systems such as humans learn in the presence of both labeled and unlabeled data. Traditionally, learning has been studied either in the unsupervised paradigm (e.g., clustering, outlier detection) where all the data is unlabeled, or in the supervised paradigm (e.g., classification, regression) where all the data is labeled. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to understand how combining labeled and unlabeled data may change the learning behavior, and design algorithms that take advantage of such a combination. Semi-supervised learning is of great interest in machine learning and data mining because it can use readily available unlabeled data to improve supervised learning tasks when the labeled data is scarce or expensive. Semi-supervised learning also shows potential as a quantitative tool to understand human category learning, where most of the input is self-evidently unlabeled. In this introductory book, we present some popular semi-supervised learning models, including self-training, mixture models, co-training and multiview learning, graph-based methods, and semisupervised support vector machines. For each model, we discuss its basic mathematical formulation. The success of semi-supervised learning depends critically on some underlying assumptions. We emphasize the assumptions made by each model and give counterexamples when appropriate to demonstrate the limitations of the different models. In addition, we discuss semi-supervised learning for cognitive psychology. Finally, we give a computational learning theoretic perspective on semisupervised learning, and we conclude the book with a brief discussion of open questions in the field.},

  abstract = {Due to the Internet Revolution, human conversational data--in written forms--are accumulating at a phenomenal rate. At the same time, improvements in speech technology enable many spoken conversations to be transcribed. Individuals and organizations engage in email exchanges, face-to-face meetings, blogging, texting and other social media activities. The advances in natural language processing provide ample opportunities for these "informal documents" to be analyzed and mined, thus creating numerous new and valuable applications. This book presents a set of computational methods to extract information from conversational data, and to provide natural language summaries of the data. The book begins with an overview of basic concepts, such as the differences between extractive and abstractive summaries, and metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of summarization and various extraction tasks. It also describes some of the benchmark corpora used in the literature. The book introduces extraction and mining methods for performing subjectivity and sentiment detection, topic segmentation and modeling, and the extraction of conversational structure. It also describes frameworks for conducting dialogue act recognition, decision and action item detection, and extraction of thread structure. There is a specific focus on performing all these tasks on conversational data, such as meeting transcripts (which exemplify synchronous conversations) and emails (which exemplify asynchronous conversations). Very recent approaches to deal with blogs, discussion forums and microblogs (e.g., Twitter) are also discussed. The second half of this book focuses on natural language summarization of conversational data. It gives an overview of several extractive and abstractive summarizers developed for emails, meetings, blogs and forums. It also describes attempts for building multi-modal summarizers. Last but not least, the book concludes with thoughts on topics for further development.},

@book{augsten2014similarity,
  abstract = {State-of-the-art database systems manage and process a variety of complex objects, including strings and trees. For such objects equality comparisons are often not meaningful and must be replaced by similarity comparisons. This book describes the concepts and techniques to incorporate similarity into database systems. We start out by discussing the properties of strings and trees, and identify the edit distance as the de facto standard for comparing complex objects. Since the edit distance is computationally expensive, token-based distances have been introduced to speed up edit distance computations. The basic idea is to decompose complex objects into sets of tokens that can be compared efficiently. Token-based distances are used to compute an approximation of the edit distance and prune expensive edit distance calculations. A key observation when computing similarity joins is that many of the object pairs, for which the similarity is computed, are very different from each other. Filters exploit this property to improve the performance of similarity joins. A filter preprocesses the input data sets and produces a set of candidate pairs. The distance function is evaluated on the candidate pairs only. We describe the essential query processing techniques for filters based on lower and upper bounds. For token equality joins we describe prefix, size, positional and partitioning filters, which can be used to avoid the computation of small intersections that are not needed since the similarity would be too low.},

@book{alishahi2011computational,
  abstract = {Human language acquisition has been studied for centuries, but using computational modeling for such studies is a relatively recent trend. However, computational approaches to language learning have become increasingly popular, mainly due to advances in developing machine learning techniques, and the availability of vast collections of experimental data on child language learning and child-adult interaction. Many of the existing computational models attempt to study the complex task of learning a language under cognitive plausibility criteria (such as memory and processing limitations that humans face), and to explain the developmental stages observed in children. By simulating the process of child language learning, computational models can show us which linguistic representations are learnable from the input that children have access to, and which mechanisms yield the same patterns of behaviour that children exhibit during this process. In doing so, computational modeling provides insight into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language acquisition, and inspires the development of better language models and techniques. This book provides an overview of the main research questions in the field of human language acquisition. It reviews the most commonly used computational frameworks, methodologies and resources for modeling child language learning, and the evaluation techniques used for assessing these computational models. The book is aimed at cognitive scientists who want to become familiar with the available computational methods for investigating problems related to human language acquisition, as well as computational linguists who are interested in applying their skills to the study of child language acquisition. Different aspects of language learning are discussed in separate chapters, including the acquisition of the individual words, the general regularities which govern word and sentence form, and the associations between form and meaning. For each of these aspects, the challenges of the task are discussed and the relevant empirical findings on children are summarized. Furthermore, the existing computational models that attempt to simulate the task under study are reviewed, and a number of case studies are presented.},

@book{ilyas2011probabilistic,
  abstract = {Ranking queries are widely used in data exploration, data analysis and decision making scenarios. While most of the currently proposed ranking techniques focus on deterministic data, several emerging applications involve data that are imprecise or uncertain. Ranking uncertain data raises new challenges in query semantics and processing, making conventional methods inapplicable. Furthermore, the interplay between ranking and uncertainty models introduces new dimensions for ordering query results that do not exist in the traditional settings. This lecture describes new formulations and processing techniques for ranking queries on uncertain data. The formulations are based on marriage of traditional ranking semantics with possible worlds semantics under widely-adopted uncertainty models. In particular, we focus on discussing the impact of tuple-level and attribute-level uncertainty on the semantics and processing techniques of ranking queries. Under the tuple-level uncertainty model, we describe new processing techniques leveraging the capabilities of relational database systems to recognize and handle data uncertainty in score-based ranking. Under the attribute-level uncertainty model, we describe new probabilistic ranking models and a set of query evaluation algorithms, including sampling-based techniques. We also discuss supporting rank join queries on uncertain data, and we show how to extend current rank join methods to handle uncertainty in scoring attributes.},

To a large extent, this has been fueled by the spectacular growth of social media and online social networking sites, which continue growing at a very fast pace, as well as by the increasing availability of very large social network datasets for purposes of research. A rich body of this research has been devoted to the analysis of the propagation of information, influence, innovations, infections, practices and customs through networks. Can we build models to explain the way these propagations occur? How can we validate our models against any available real datasets consisting of a social network and propagation traces that occurred in the past? These are just some questions studied by researchers in this area. Information propagation models find applications in viral marketing, outbreak detection, finding key blog posts to read in order to catch important stories, finding leaders or trendsetters, information feed ranking, etc. A number of algorithmic problems arising in these applications have been abstracted and studied extensively by researchers under the garb of influence maximization.},

@book{dragut2012query,
  abstract = {There are millions of searchable data sources on the web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.},

A database system typically aims to support the creation, maintenance, and use of large amount of data, focusing on the quantity of data.

Dirty data in a database routinely generate misleading or biased analytical results and decisions, and lead to loss of revenues, credibility and customers. With this comes the need for data quality management. In contrast to traditional data management tasks, data quality management enables the detection and correction of errors in the data, syntactic or semantic, in order to improve the quality of the data and hence, add value to business processes.},

A language-understanding system should be able to find such relations in documents and progressively build a knowledge base or even an ontology.

@book{cimiano2014ontologybased,
  abstract = {For humans, understanding a natural language sentence or discourse is so effortless that we hardly ever think about it. For machines, however, the task of interpreting natural language, especially grasping meaning beyond the literal content, has proven extremely difficult and requires a large amount of background knowledge. This book focuses on the interpretation of natural language with respect to specific domain knowledge captured in ontologies. the main contribution is an approach that puts ontologies at the center of the interpretation process. This means that ontologies not only provide a formalization of domain knowledge necessary for interpretation but also support and guide the construction of meaning representations. We start with an introduction to ontologies and demonstrate how linguistic information can be attached to them by means of the ontology lexicon model lemon. These lexica then serve as basis for the automatic generation of grammars, which we use to compositionally construct meaning representations that conform with the vocabulary of an underlying ontology. As a result, the level of representational granularity is not driven by language but by the semantic distinctions made in the underlying ontology and thus by distinctions that are relevant in the context of a particular domain. We highlight some of the challenges involved in the construction of ontology-based meaning representations, and show how ontologies can be exploited for ambiguity resolution and the interpretation of temporal expressions. Finally, we present a question answering system that combines all tools and techniques introduced throughout the book in a real-world application, and sketch how the presented approach can scale to larger, multi-domain scenarios in the context of the Semantic Web.},

A feasible and sound way of exploiting this data for linguistic research is to compile a static corpus for a given language. There are several advantages of this approach: (i) Working with such corpora obviates the problems encountered when using Internet search engines in quantitative linguistic research (such as non-transparent ranking algorithms). (ii) Creating a corpus from web data is virtually free. (iii) The size of corpora compiled from the WWW may exceed by several orders of magnitudes the size of language resources offered elsewhere. (iv) The data is locally available to the user, and it can be linguistically post-processed and queried with the tools preferred by her/him. This book addresses the main practical tasks in the creation of web corpora up to giga-token size. Among these tasks are the sampling process (i. e., web crawling) and the usual cleanups including boilerplate removal and removal of duplicated content. Linguistic processing and problems with linguistic processing coming from the different kinds of noise in web corpora are also covered. Finally, the authors show how web corpora can be evaluated and compared to other corpora (such as traditionally compiled corpora).},

While extremely successful, these major search engines do have serious limitations. This book introduces large-scale metasearch engine technology, which has the potential to overcome the limitations of the major search engines. Essentially, a metasearch engine is a search system that supports unified access to multiple existing search engines by passing the queries it receives to its component search engines and aggregating the returned results into a single ranked list. A large-scale metasearch engine has thousands or more component search engines. While metasearch engines were initially motivated by their ability to combine the search coverage of multiple search engines, there are also other benefits such as the potential to obtain better and fresher results and to reach the DeepWeb. The following major components of large-scale metasearch engines will be discussed in detail in this book: search engine selection, search engine incorporation, and result merging. Highly scalable and automated solutions for these components are emphasized. The authors make a strong case for the viability of the large-scale metasearch engine technology as a competitive technology for Web search.},

@book{teubner2013processing,
  abstract = {Computer architectures are quickly changing toward heterogeneous many-core systems. Such a trend opens up interesting opportunities but also raises immense challenges since the efficient use of heterogeneous many-core systems is not a trivial problem. In this paper, we explore how to program data processing operators on top of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are very versatile in terms of how they can be used and can also be added as additional processing units in standard CPU sockets. In the paper, we study how data processing can be accelerated using an FPGA. Our results indicate that efficient usage of FPGAs involves non-trivial aspects such as having the right computation model (an asynchronous sorting network in this case); a careful implementation that balances all the design constraints in an FPGA; and the proper integration strategy to link the FPGA to the rest of the system. Once these issues are properly addressed, our experiments show that FPGAs exhibit performance figures competitive with those of modern general-purpose CPUs while offering significant advantages in terms of power consumption and parallel stream evaluation.},

@book{settles2012active,
  abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can perform better with less training if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose "queries," usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an "oracle" (e.g., a human annotator) that already understands the nature of the problem. This sort of approach is well-motivated in many modern machine learning and data mining applications, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easy to come by, but training labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This book is a general introduction to active learning. It outlines several scenarios in which queries might be formulated, and details many query selection algorithms which have been organized into four broad categories, or "query selection frameworks."We also touch on some of the theoretical foundations of active learning, and conclude with an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in practice, including a summary of ongoing work to address these open challenges and opportunities.},

This book provides a basic introduction to both fields, and aims to show that good linguistic annotations are the essential foundation for good text analytics. After briefly reviewing the basics of XML, with practical exercises illustrating in-line and stand-off annotations, a chapter is devoted to explaining the different levels of linguistic annotations. The reader is encouraged to create example annotations using the WordFreak linguistic annotation tool. The next chapter shows how annotations can be created automatically using statistical NLP tools, and compares two sets of tools, the OpenNLP and Stanford NLP tools. The second half of the book describes different annotation formats and gives practical examples of how to interchange annotations between different formats using XSLT transformations. The two main text analytics architectures, GATE and UIMA, are then described and compared, with practical exercises showing how to configure and customize them. The final chapter is an introduction to text analytics, describing the main applications and functions including named entity recognition, coreference resolution and information extraction, with practical examples using both open source and commercial tools. Copies of the example files, scripts, and stylesheets used in the book are available from the companion website, located at http://sites.morganclaypool.com/wilcock.},

@book{ganti2013cleaning,
  abstract = {Data warehouses consolidate various activities of a business and often form the backbone for generating reports that support important business decisions. Errors in data tend to creep in for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include errors during input data collection and errors while merging data collected independently across different databases. These errors in data warehouses often result in erroneous upstream reports, and could impact business decisions negatively. Therefore, one of the critical challenges while maintaining large data warehouses is that of ensuring the quality of data in the data warehouse remains high. The process of maintaining high data quality is commonly referred to as data cleaning. In this book, we first discuss the goals of data cleaning. Often, the goals of data cleaning are not well defined and could mean different solutions in different scenarios. Toward clarifying these goals, we abstract out a common set of data cleaning tasks that often need to be addressed. This abstraction allows us to develop solutions for these common data cleaning tasks. We then discuss a few popular approaches for developing such solutions. In particular, we focus on an operator-centric approach for developing a data cleaning platform. The operator-centric approach involves the development of customizable operators that could be used as building blocks for developing common solutions. This is similar to the approach of relational algebra for query processing. The basic set of operators can be put together to build complex queries. Finally, we discuss the development of custom scripts which leverage the basic data cleaning operators along with relational operators to implement effective solutions for data cleaning tasks.},

@book{naumann2010introduction,
  abstract = {With the ever increasing volume of data, data quality problems abound. Multiple, yet different representations of the same real-world objects in data, duplicates, are one of the most intriguing data quality problems. The effects of such duplicates are detrimental; for instance, bank customers can obtain duplicate identities, inventory levels are monitored incorrectly, catalogs are mailed multiple times to the same household, etc. Automatically detecting duplicates is difficult: First, duplicate representations are usually not identical but slightly differ in their values. Second, in principle all pairs of records should be compared, which is infeasible for large volumes of data. This lecture examines closely the two main components to overcome these difficulties: (i) Similarity measures are used to automatically identify duplicates when comparing two records. Well-chosen similarity measures improve the effectiveness of duplicate detection. (ii) Algorithms are developed to perform on very large volumes of data in search for duplicates. Well-designed algorithms improve the efficiency of duplicate detection. Finally, we discuss methods to evaluate the success of duplicate detection.},

It is well known that the chase algorithm might be non-terminating and thus, in order for it to find practical applicability, it is crucial to identify cases where its termination is guaranteed. Another important aspect to consider when dealing with the chase is that it can introduce null values into the database, thereby leading to incomplete data. Thus, in several scenarios where the chase is used the problem of dealing with data dependencies and incomplete data arises. This book discusses fundamental issues concerning data dependencies and incomplete data with a particular focus on the chase and its applications in different database areas. We report recent results about the crucial issue of identifying conditions that guarantee the chase termination. Different database applications where the chase is a central tool are discussed with particular attention devoted to query answering in the presence of data dependencies and database schema design.},

However, query processing techniques for deterministic data cannot be directly applied to uncertain data because they do not have mechanisms to handle the data uncertainty. Therefore, efficient and effective manipulation of uncertain data is a practical yet challenging research topic. In this book, we start from the data models for imprecise and uncertain data, move on to defining different semantics for queries on uncertain data, and finally discuss the advanced query processing techniques for various probabilistic queries in uncertain databases. The book serves as a comprehensive guideline for query processing over uncertain databases.},

@book{agrawal2013management,
  abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a successful paradigm of service-oriented computing and has revolutionized the way computing infrastructure is used. This success has seen a proliferation in the number of applications that are being deployed in various cloud platforms. There has also been an increase in the scale of the data generated as well as consumed by such applications. Scalable database management systems form a critical part of the cloud infrastructure. The attempt to address the challenges posed by the management of big data has led to a plethora of systems. This book aims to clarify some of the important concepts in the design space of scalable data management in cloud computing infrastructures. Some of the questions that this book aims to answer are: the appropriate systems for a specific set of application requirements, the research challenges in data management for the cloud, and what is novel in the cloud for database researchers? We also aim to address one basic question: whether cloud computing poses new challenges in scalable data management or it is just a reincarnation of old problems? We provide a comprehensive background study of state-of-the-art systems for scalable data management and analysis. We also identify important aspects in the design of different systems and the applicability and scope of these systems. A thorough understanding of current solutions and a precise characterization of the design space are essential for clearing the "cloudy skies of data management" and ensuring the success of DBMSs in the cloud, thus emulating the success enjoyed by relational databases in traditional enterprise settings.},

It is accessible to readers who have taken college-level courses in calculus and probability, networking and operating systems. This is not a training manual for becoming an expert performance analyst. Rather, the objective is to help the reader construct simple models for analyzing and understanding the systems that they are interested in. Describing a complicated system abstractly with mathematical equations requires a careful choice of assumptions and approximations. They make the model tractable, but they must not remove essential characteristics of the system, nor introduce spurious properties. To help the reader understand the choices and their implications, this book discusses the analytical models for 30 research papers. These papers cover a broad range of topics: processors and disks, routers and crawling, databases and multimedia, worms and wireless, multicore and cloud, etc. An appendix provides many questions for readers to exercise their understanding of the models in these papers.},

Indeed, the emerging field of digital humanities heavily relies on the availability of digital text for its studies. Together with the increasing availability of historical texts in digital form, there is a growing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) methods and tools to historical texts.

@book{golab2010stream,
  abstract = {In this lecture many applications process high volumes of streaming data, among them Internet traffic analysis, financial tickers, and transaction log mining. In general, a data stream is an unbounded data set that is produced incrementally over time, rather than being available in full before its processing begins. In this lecture, we give an overview of recent research in stream processing, ranging from answering simple queries on high-speed streams to loading real-time data feeds into a streaming warehouse for off-line analysis. We will discuss two types of systems for end-to-end stream processing: Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) and Streaming Data Warehouses (SDWs).A traditional database management system typically processes a stream of ad-hoc queries over relatively static data. In contrast, a DSMS evaluates static (long-running) queries on streaming data, making a single pass over the data and using limited working memory. In the first part of this lecture, we will discuss research problems in DSMSs, such as continuous query languages, non-blocking query operators that continually react to new data, and continuous query optimization. The second part covers SDWs, which combine the real-time response of a DSMS by loading new data as soon as they arrive with a data warehouse's ability to manage Terabytes of historical data on secondary storage.},

So far this interface layer has been missing in AI. First-order logic and probabilistic graphical models each have some of the necessary features, but a viable interface layer requires combining both. Markov logic is a powerful new language that accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and treating them as templates for features of Markov random fields. Most statistical models in wide use are special cases of Markov logic, and first-order logic is its infinite-weight limit. Inference algorithms for Markov logic combine ideas from satisfiability, Markov chain Monte Carlo, belief propagation, and resolution. Learning algorithms make use of conditional likelihood, convex optimization, and inductive logic programming. Markov logic has been successfully applied to problems in information extraction and integration, natural language processing, robot mapping, social networks, computational biology, and others, and is the basis of the open-source Alchemy system.},

Data exchange is an old problem that re-emerged as an active research topic recently, due to the increased need for exchange of data in various formats, often in e-business applications. In this lecture, we give an overview of the basic concepts of data exchange in both relational and XML contexts. We give examples of data exchange problems, and we introduce the main tasks that need to addressed. We then discuss relational data exchange, concentrating on issues such as relational schema mappings, materializing target instances (including canonical solutions and cores), query answering, and query rewriting. After that, we discuss metadata management, i.e., handling schema mappings themselves. We pay particular attention to operations on schema mappings, such as composition and inverse. Finally, we describe both data exchange and metadata management in the context of XML. We use mappings based on transforming tree patterns, and we show that they lead to a host of new problems that did not arise in the relational case, but they need to be addressed for XML. These include consistency issues for mappings and schemas, as well as imposing tighter restrictions on mappings and queries to achieve tractable query answering in data exchange.},

@book{yu2010keyword,
  abstract = {It has become highly desirable to provide users with flexible ways to query/search information over databases as simple as keyword search like Google search. This book surveys the recent developments on keyword search over databases, and focuses on finding structural information among objects in a database using a set of keywords. Such structural information to be returned can be either trees or subgraphs representing how the objects, that contain the required keywords, are interconnected in a relational database or in an XML database. The structural keyword search is completely different from finding documents that contain all the user-given keywords. The former focuses on the interconnected object structures, whereas the latter focuses on the object content. The book is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, we highlight the main research issues on the structural keyword search in different contexts. In Chapter 2, we focus on supporting structural keyword search in a relational database management system using the SQL query language. We concentrate on how to generate a set of SQL queries that can find all the structural information among records in a relational database completely, and how to evaluate the generated set of SQL queries efficiently. In Chapter 3,we discuss graph algorithms for structural keyword search by treating an entire relational database as a large data graph. In Chapter 4, we discuss structural keyword search in a large tree-structuredXMLdatabase. In Chapter 5,we highlight several interesting research issues regarding keyword search on databases. The book can be used as either an extended survey for people who are interested in the structural keyword search or a reference book for a postgraduate course on the related topics.},

The Web also contains a rich and dynamic collection of hyperlink information, Web page access and usage information, providing sources for data mining. The amount of information on the Web is growing rapidly, as well as the number of Web sites and Web pages per Web site. Consequently, it has become more difficult to find relevant and useful information for Web users. Web usage mining is concerned with guiding the Web users to discover useful knowledge and supporting them for decision-making. In that context, predicting the needs of a Web user as she visits Web sites has gained importance. The requirement for predicting user needs in order to guide the user in a Web site and improve the usability of the Web site can be addressed by recommending pages to the user that are related to the interest of the user at that time. This monograph gives an overview of the research in the area of discovering and modeling the users' interest in order to recommend related Web pages. The Web page recommender systems studied in this monograph are categorized according to the data mining algorithms they use for recommendation.},

  abstract = {As online information grows dramatically, search engines such as Google are playing a more and more important role in our lives. Critical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective retrieval model that can rank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research problem in information retrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval models, often referred to as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many different information retrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector space model, these new models have a more sound statistical foundation and can leverage statistical estimation to optimize retrieval parameters. They can also be more easily adapted to model nontraditional and complex retrieval problems. Empirically, they tend to achieve comparable or better performance than a traditional model with less effort on parameter tuning. This book systematically reviews the large body of literature on applying statistical language models to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles, empirically effective language models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. All the relevant literature has been synthesized to make it easy for a reader to digest the research progress achieved so far and see the frontier of research in this area. The book also offers practitioners an informative introduction to a set of practically useful language models that can effectively solve a variety of retrieval problems. No prior knowledge about information retrieval is required, but some basic knowledge about probability and statistics would be useful for fully digesting all the details.},

Thus, they are well suited for large-scale data sharing in distributed environments. Most of the existing P2P approaches for data sharing rely on either structured networks (e.g., DHTs) for efficient indexing, or unstructured networks for ease of deployment, or some combination. However, these approaches have some limitations, such as lack of freedom for data placement in DHTs, and high latency and high network traffic in unstructured networks. To address these limitations, gossip protocols which are easy to deploy and scale well, can be exploited. In this book, we will give a overview of these different P2P techniques and architectures, discuss their trade-offs and illustrate their use for decentralizing several large-scale data sharing applications.},

This is particularly crucial in today's open and interconnected world, where each kind of information can be easily made available to a huge user population, and where a damage or misuse of data may have unpredictable consequences that go beyond the boundaries where data reside or have been generated. This book provides an overview of the various developments in access control for data management systems. Discretionary, mandatory, and role-based access control will be discussed, by surveying the most relevant proposals and analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of each paradigm in view of the requirements of different application domains. Access control mechanisms provided by commercial Data Management Systems are presented and discussed. Finally, the last part of the book is devoted to discussion of some of the most challenging and innovative research trends in the area of access control, such as those related to the Web 2.0 revolution or to the Database as a Service paradigm. This book is a valuable reference for an heterogeneous audience. It can be used as either an extended survey for people who are interested in access control or as a reference book for senior undergraduate or graduate courses in data security with a special focus on access control. It is also useful for technologists, researchers, managers, and developers who want to know more about access control and related emerging trends.},

@book{mausam2012planning,
  abstract = {Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are widely popular in Artificial Intelligence for modeling sequential decision-making scenarios with probabilistic dynamics. They are the framework of choice when designing an intelligent agent that needs to act for long periods of time in an environment where its actions could have uncertain outcomes. MDPs are actively researched in two related subareas of AI, probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning. Probabilistic planning assumes known models for the agent's goals and domain dynamics, and focuses on determining how the agent should behave to achieve its objectives. On the other hand, reinforcement learning additionally learns these models based on the feedback the agent gets from the environment. This book provides a concise introduction to the use of MDPs for solving probabilistic planning problems, with an emphasis on the algorithmic perspective. It covers the whole spectrum of the field, from the basics to state-of-the-art optimal and approximation algorithms. We first describe the theoretical foundations of MDPs and the fundamental solution techniques for them. We then discuss modern optimal algorithms based on heuristic search and the use of structured representations. A major focus of the book is on the numerous approximation schemes for MDPs that have been developed in the AI literature. These include determinization-based approaches, sampling techniques, heuristic functions, dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical representations. Finally, we briefly introduce several extensions of the standard MDP classes that model and solve even more complex planning problems.},

@book{nie2010crosslanguage,
  abstract = {Search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other languages. This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query. In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another. However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents. Specific translation methods are thus required. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specific problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems. The book starts with a general description of the monolingual IR and CLIR problems. Different classes of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an MT system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel and comparable corpora. In addition, the typical retrieval effectiveness using different approaches is compared. It will be shown that translation approaches specifically designed for CLIR can rival and outperform high-quality MT systems. Finally, the book offers a look into the future that draws a strong parallel between query expansion in monolingual IR and query translation in CLIR, suggesting that many approaches developed in monolingual IR can be adapted to CLIR. The book can be used as an introduction to CLIR. Advanced readers can also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining research challenges in the future. It is suitable to new researchers who intend to carry out research on CLIR.},

An appreciation of the concrete data sources, their interfaces and how such capabilities relate to logical design is commonly called a physical design. This book is an introduction to the fundamental methods underlying database technology that solves the problem of query compilation. The methods are presented in terms of first-order logic which serves as the vehicle for specifying physical design, expressing user requests and query plans, and understanding how query plans implement user requests.},

@book{wong2010privacypreserving,
  abstract = {Privacy preservation has become a major issue in many data analysis applications. When a data set is released to other parties for data analysis, privacy-preserving techniques are often required to reduce the possibility of identifying sensitive information about individuals. For example, in medical data, sensitive information can be the fact that a particular patient suffers from HIV. In spatial data, sensitive information can be a specific location of an individual. In web surfing data, the information that a user browses certain websites may be considered sensitive. Consider a dataset containing some sensitive information is to be released to the public. In order to protect sensitive information, the simplest solution is not to disclose the information. However, this would be an overkill since it will hinder the process of data analysis over the data from which we can find interesting patterns. Moreover, in some applications, the data must be disclosed under the government regulations. Alternatively, the data owner can first modify the data such that the modified data can guarantee privacy and, at the same time, the modified data retains sufficient utility and can be released to other parties safely. This process is usually called as privacy-preserving data publishing. In this monograph, we study how the data owner can modify the data and how the modified data can preserve privacy and protect sensitive information.},

This task can be understood as the inverse of the problem solved in different ways by diverse human languages, namely, how to indicate the relationship between different parts of a sentence. Understanding how languages solve the problem can be extremely useful in both feature design and error analysis in the application of machine learning to NLP. Likewise, understanding cross-linguistic variation can be important for the design of MT systems and other multilingual applications. The purpose of this book is to present in a succinct and accessible fashion information about the morphological and syntactic structure of human languages that can be useful in creating more linguistically sophisticated, more language-independent, and thus more successful NLP systems.},

@book{bertino2012protection,
  abstract = {As data represent a key asset for today's organizations, the problem of how to protect this data from theft and misuse is at the forefront of these organizations' minds. Even though today several data security techniques are available to protect data and computing infrastructures, many such techniques--such as firewalls and network security tools--are unable to protect data from attacks posed by those working on an organization's "inside." These "insiders" usually have authorized access to relevant information systems, making it extremely challenging to block the misuse of information while still allowing them to do their jobs. This book discusses several techniques that can provide effective protection against attacks posed by people working on the inside of an organization. Chapter 1 introduces the notion of insider threat and reports some data about data breaches due to insider threats. Chapter 2 covers authentication and access control techniques, and Chapter 3 shows how these general security techniques can be extended and used in the context of protection from insider threats. Chapter 4 addresses anomaly detection techniques that are used to determine anomalies in data accesses by insiders. These anomalies are often indicative of potential insider data attacks and therefore play an important role in protection from these attacks. Security information and event management (SIEM) tools and fine-grained auditing are discussed in Chapter 5. These tools aim at collecting, analyzing, and correlating--in real-time--any information and event that may be relevant for the security of an organization. As such, they can be a key element in finding a solution to such undesirable insider threats. Chapter 6 goes on to provide a survey of techniques for separation-of-duty (SoD). SoD is an important principle that, when implemented in systems and tools, can strengthen data protection from malicious insiders. However, to date, very few approaches have been proposed for implementing SoD in systems. In Chapter 7, a short survey of a commercial product is presented, which provides different techniques for protection from malicious users with system privileges--such as a DBA in database management systems. Finally, in Chapter 8, the book concludes with a few remarks and additional research directions.},

Search over large datasets has always been a key problem in peer-to-peer systems and the peer-to-peer paradigm has incited novel directions in the field of data management. This resulted in many novel peer-to-peer data management concepts and algorithms, for supporting data management tasks in a wider sense, including data integration, document management and text retrieval. The lecture covers four different types of peer-to-peer data management systems that are characterized by the type of data they manage and the search capabilities they support. The first type are structured peer-to-peer data management systems which support structured query capabilities for standard data models. The second type are peer-to-peer data integration systems for querying of heterogeneous databases without requiring a common global schema. The third type are peer-to-peer document retrieval systems that enable document search based both on the textual content and the document structure. Finally, we introduce semantic overlay networks, which support similarity search on information represented in hierarchically organized and multi-dimensional semantic spaces. Topics that go beyond data representation and search are summarized at the end of the lecture.},

We first explore some ways of assigning structure on the document level: the logical document structure as determined by the layout of the text, its genre-specific content structure, and its breakdown into topical segments. Then the focus moves to phenomena of local coherence. We introduce the problem of coreference and look at methods for building chains of coreferring entities in the text. Next, the notion of coherence relation is introduced as the second important factor of local coherence. We study the role of connectives and other means of signaling such relations in text, and then return to the level of larger textual units, where tree or graph structures can be ascribed by recursively assigning coherence relations. Taken together, these descriptions can inform text summarization, information extraction, discourse-aware sentiment analysis, question answering, and the like.},

@book{mani2013computational,
  abstract = {The field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation is one of the oldest in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which is hardly surprising, since storytelling is such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and social activity. In recent years, the demands of interactive entertainment and interest in the creation of engaging narratives with life-like characters have provided a fresh impetus to this field. This book provides an overview of the principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in modeling the narrative structure of stories. The book introduces classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their mapping to computational approaches. It demonstrates how research in AI and NLP has modeled character goals, causality, and time using formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning, and temporal reasoning, and discusses fundamental limitations in such approaches. It proposes new representations for embedded narratives and fictional entities, for assessing the pace of a narrative, and offers an empirical theory of audience response. These notions are incorporated into an annotation scheme called NarrativeML. The book identifies key issues that need to be addressed, including annotation methods for long literary narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and characterizing the goals of narrators. It also suggests a future characterized by advanced text mining of narrative structure from large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of useful authoring aids. This is the first book to provide a systematic foundation that integrates together narratology, AI, and computational linguistics. It can serve as a narratology primer for computer scientists and an elucidation of computational narratology for literary theorists. It is written in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a broad scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and formal semanticists), AI researchers, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.},

This provides the analysts a better perspective of the organizational needs centered around the data. As such, this research is of fundamental importance. Much of the success of database systems in the last decade is due to the beauty and elegance of the relational model and its declarative query languages, combined with a rich spectrum of underlying evaluation and optimization techniques, and efficient implementations. Much like the case for traditional database research, elegant modeling and rich underlying technology are likely to be highly beneficiary for the Business Process owners and their users; both can benefit from easy formulation and analysis of the processes. While there have been many important advances in this research in recent years, there is still much to be desired: specifically, there have been many works that focus on the processes behavior (flow), and many that focus on its data, but only very few works have dealt with both the state-of-the-art in a database approach to Business Process modeling and analysis, the progress towards a holistic flow-and-data framework for these tasks, and highlight the current gaps and research directions.},

However, it can also be used for advanced secondary school students, and it can be used at the start of graduate school for those who have not yet seen the material. The approach to teaching logic used here emerged from more than 20 years of teaching logic to students at Stanford University and from teaching logic to tens of thousands of others via online courses on the World Wide Web. The approach differs from that taken by other books in logic in two essential ways, one having to do with content, the other with form. Like many other books on logic, this one covers logical syntax and semantics and proof theory plus induction. However, unlike other books, this book begins with Herbrand semantics rather than the more traditional Tarskian semantics. This approach makes the material considerably easier for students to understand and leaves them with a deeper understanding of what logic is all about.},

  abstract = {Schema matching is the task of providing correspondences between concepts describing the meaning of data in various heterogeneous, distributed data sources. Schema matching is one of the basic operations required by the process of data and schema integration, and thus has a great effect on its outcomes, whether these involve targeted content delivery, view integration, database integration, query rewriting over heterogeneous sources, duplicate data elimination, or automatic streamlining of workflow activities that involve heterogeneous data sources. Although schema matching research has been ongoing for over 25 years, more recently a realization has emerged that schema matchers are inherently uncertain. Since 2003, work on the uncertainty in schema matching has picked up, along with research on uncertainty in other areas of data management. This lecture presents various aspects of uncertainty in schema matching within a single unified framework. We introduce basic formulations of uncertainty and provide several alternative representations of schema matching uncertainty. Then, we cover two common methods that have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in schema matching, namely ensembles, and top-K matchings, and analyze them in this context. We conclude with a set of real-world applications.},

@article{collins2012creating,
  abstract = {In Ireland, while detailed information is available regarding hospital attendance, little is known regarding general (family) practice attendance. However, it is conservatively estimated that there are almost nine times as many general practice encounters than there are hospital encounters each year in Ireland. This represents a very significant gap in health information. Indeed, general practice has been shown in other countries to be an important and rich source of information about the health of the population, their behaviors and their utilization of health services. Funded by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) undertook a feasibility study of diagnostic coding of routinely entered patient data and the creation of a national general practice morbidity and epidemiological database (GPMED project). This article outlines the process of data quality issue management undertaken. The study‚Äôs findings suggest that the quality of data collection and reporting structures available in general practice throughout Ireland at the outset of this project were not adequate to permit the creation of a database of sufficient quality for service planning and policy or epidemiological research. Challenges include the dearth of a minimum standard of data recorded in consultations by GPs and the absence of the digital data recording and exporting infrastructure within Irish patient management software systems. In addition, there is at present a lack of recognition regarding the value of such data for patient management and service planning---including importantly, data collectors who do not fully accept the merit of maintaining data, which has a direct consequence for data quality. The work of this project has substantial implications for the data available to the health sector in Ireland and contributes to the knowledge base internationally regarding general practice morbidity data.},

@article{muller2012improving,
  abstract = {In many domains, data cleaning is hampered by our limited ability to specify a comprehensive set of integrity constraints to assist in identification of erroneous data. An alternative approach to improve data quality is to exploit different data sources that contain information about the same set of objects. Such overlapping sources highlight hot-spots of poor data quality through conflicting data values and immediately provide alternative values for conflict resolution. In order to derive a dataset of high quality, we can merge the overlapping sources based on a quality assessment of the conflicting values. The quality of the resulting dataset, however, is highly dependent on our ability to asses the quality of conflicting values effectively. The main objective of this article is to introduce methods that aid the developer of an integrated system over overlapping, but contradicting sources in the task of improving the quality of data. Value conflicts between contradicting sources are often systematic, caused by some characteristic of the different sources. Our goal is to identify such systematic differences and outline data patterns that occur in conjunction with them. Evaluated by an expert user, the regularities discovered provide insights into possible conflict reasons and help to assess the quality of inconsistent values. The contributions of this article are two concepts of systematic conflicts: contradiction patterns and minimal update sequences. Contradiction patterns resemble a special form of association rules that summarize characteristic data properties for conflict occurrence. We adapt existing association rule mining algorithms for mining contradiction patterns. Contradiction patterns, however, view each class of conflicts in isolation, sometimes leading to largely overlapping patterns. Sequences of set-oriented update operations that transform one data source into the other are compact descriptions for all regular differences among the sources. We consider minimal update sequences as the most likely explanation for observed differences between overlapping data sources. Furthermore, the order of operations within the sequences point out potential dependencies between systematic differences. Finding minimal update sequences, however, is beyond reach in practice. We show that the problem already is NP-complete for a restricted set of operations. In the light of this intractability result, we present heuristics that lead to convincing results for all examples we considered.},

  abstract = {It is now assumed that poor quality data is costing large amounts of money to corporations all over the world. Although research on methods and techniques for data quality assessment and improvement have begun in the early nineties of the past century and being currently abundant and innovative, it is noted that the academic and professional communities virtually have no dialogue, which turns out to be harmful to both of them. The challenge of promoting the relevance in information systems research, without compromising the necessary rigor, is still present in the various disciplines of information systems scientific area, including the data quality one. In this paper we present ‚Äúdata as a corporate asset‚Äù as a business philosophy, and a framework for the concepts related to that philosophy, derived from the academic and professional literature. According to this framework, we present, analyze and discuss a single explanatory case study, developed in a fixed and mobile telecommunications company, operating in one of the European Union Countries. The results show that, in the absence of data stewardship roles, data quality problems become more of an "IT problem" than typically is considered in the literature, owing to Requirements Analysis Teams of the IS Development Units, to become a ‚Äúquality negotiator‚Äù between the various stakeholders. Other findings are their bottom-up approach to data quality management, their biggest focus on motivating employees through innovative forms of communication, which appears to be a critical success factor (CSF) for data quality management, as well as the importance of a data quality champion leadership.},

IoT offers the capability to connect and integrate both digital and physical entities, enabling a whole new class of applications and services, but several significant challenges need to be addressed before these applications and services can be fully realized. A fundamental challenge centers around managing IoT data, typically produced in dynamic and volatile environments, which is not only extremely large in scale and volume, but also noisy and continuous. This paper reviews the main techniques and state-of-the-art research efforts in IoT from data-centric perspectives, including data stream processing, data storage models, complex event processing, and searching in IoT. Open research issues for IoT data management are also discussed. },

@article{even2009assessment,
  abstract = {Quantitative assessment of data quality is critical for identifying the presence of data defects and the extent of the damage due to these defects. Quantitative assessment can help define realistic quality improvement targets, track progress, evaluate the impacts of different solutions, and prioritize improvement efforts accordingly. This study describes a methodology for quantitatively assessing both impartial and contextual data quality in large datasets. Impartial assessment measures the extent to which a dataset is defective, independent of the context in which that dataset is used. Contextual assessment, as defined in this study, measures the extent to which the presence of defects reduces a dataset‚Äôs utility, the benefits gained by using that dataset in a specific context. The dual assessment methodology is demonstrated in the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), using large data samples from real-world datasets. The results from comparing the two assessments offer important insights for directing quality maintenance efforts and prioritizing quality improvement solutions for this dataset. The study describes the steps and the computation involved in the dual-assessment methodology and discusses the implications for applying the methodology in other business contexts and data environments.},

  abstract = {The number and complexity of Web applications which are part of Business Intelligence (BI) applications had grown exponentially in recent years. The amount of data used in these applications has consequently also grown. Managing data with an acceptable level of quality is paramount to success in any organizational business process. In order to raise and maintain the adequate levels of Data Quality (DQ) it is indispensable for Web applications to be able to satisfy specific DQ requirements. In order to achieve this goal, DQ requirements should be captured and introduced into the development process together with the other software requirements needed in the applications. However, in the field of Web application development, and to the best of our knowledge, no proposals exist with regard to the way in which to manage specific DQ software requirements. This paper considers the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach and, principally, the benefits provided by Model Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) in order to put forward a proposal for two artifacts. These two artifacts are a metamodel and a UML profile for the management of Data Quality Software Requirements for Web Applications (DQ_WebRE).},

  abstract = {While labeled data is expensive to prepare, ever increasing amounts of unlabeled data is becoming widely available. In order to adapt to this phenomenon, several semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, which learn from labeled as well as unlabeled data, have been developed. In a separate line of work, researchers have started to realize that graphs provide a natural way to represent data in a variety of domains. Graph-based SSL algorithms, which bring together these two lines of work, have been shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in many applications in speech processing, computer vision, natural language processing, and other areas of Artificial Intelligence. Recognizing this promising and emerging area of research, this synthesis lecture focuses on graph based SSL algorithms (e.g., label propagation methods). Our hope is that after reading this book, the reader will walk away with the following: (1) an in-depth knowledge of the current state-of- the-art in graph-based SSL algorithms, and the ability to implement them; (2) the ability to decide on the suitability of graph-based SSL methods for a problem; and (3) familiarity with different applications where graph-based SSL methods have been successfully applied.},

Contemporarily, in the adjacent field of data quality, several approaches and tools have been set out for the purpose of data profiling and cleaning. However, little effort has been made in order to formally specify metrics and techniques for data quality in a structured way. As a matter of fact, little relevance has been assigned to metadata regarding data quality and data cleaning issues. This paper aims at filling this gap, proposing a conceptual metamodel for data quality and cleaning, both applicable to operational and data warehousing contexts. The presented metadata model is integrated with OMG's CWM, offering a possible extension of this standard toward data quality.},

  abstract = {The range of information now available in queryable repositories opens up a host of possibilities for new and valuable forms of data analysis. Database query languages such as SQL and XQuery offer a concise and high-level means by which such analyses can be implemented, facilitating the extraction of relevant data subsets into either generic or bespoke data analysis environments. Unfortunately, the quality of data in these repositories is often highly variable. The data is still useful, but only if the consumer is aware of the data quality problems and can work around them. Standard query languages offer little support for this aspect of data management. In principle, however, it should be possible to embed constraints describing the consumer‚Äôs data quality requirements into the query directly, so that the query evaluator can take over responsibility for enforcing them during query processing. Most previous attempts to incorporate information quality constraints into database queries have been based around a small number of highly generic quality measures, which are defined and computed by the information provider. This is a useful approach in some application areas but, in practice, quality criteria are more commonly determined by the user of the information not by the provider. In this article, we explore an approach to incorporating quality constraints into database queries where the definition of quality is set by the user and not the provider of the information. Our approach is based around the concept of a quality view, a configurable quality assessment component into which domain-specific notions of quality can be embedded. We examine how quality views can be incorporated into XQuery, and draw from this the language features that are required in general to embed quality views into any query language. We also propose some syntactic sugar on top of XQuery to simplify the process of querying with quality constraints.},

The assessment of data quality dimensions should consider the degree to which data satisfy users' needs. User expectations are clearly related to the selected services and at the same time a service can have different characteristics depending on the type of user that accesses it. The data quality assessment process has to consider both aspects and, consequently, select a suitable evaluation function to obtain a correct interpretation of results.

  abstract = {Data integration is a critical problem in our increasingly interconnected but inevitably heterogeneous world. There are numerous data sources available in organizational databases and on public information systems like the World Wide Web. Not surprisingly, the sources often use different vocabularies and different data structures, being created, as they are, by different people, at different times, for different purposes. The goal of data integration is to provide programmatic and human users with integrated access to multiple, heterogeneous data sources, giving each user the illusion of a single, homogeneous database designed for his or her specific need. The good news is that, in many cases, the data integration process can be automated. This book is an introduction to the problem of data integration and a rigorous account of one of the leading approaches to solving this problem, viz., the relational logic approach. Relational logic provides a theoretical framework for discussing data integration. Moreover, in many important cases, it provides algorithms for solving the problem in a computationally practical way. In many respects, relational logic does for data integration what relational algebra did for database theory several decades ago. A companion web site provides interactive demonstrations of the algorithms.},

Data integration is a collaborative task that may involve many people with different degrees of experience, knowledge of the application domain, and expectations relating to the integrated resource. It may be difficult to determine and control the quality of an integrated resource due to these factors. In this article, we propose a data integration methodology that has embedded within it iterative quality assessment and improvement of the integrated resource. We also propose an architecture for the realisation of this methodology. The quality assessment is based on an ontology representation of different users‚Äô quality requirements and of the main elements of the integrated resource. We use description logic as the formal basis for reasoning about users‚Äô quality requirements and for validating that an integrated resource satisfies these requirements. We define quality factors and associated metrics which enable the quality of alternative global schemas for an integrated resource to be assessed quantitively, and hence the improvement which results from the refinement of a global schema following our methodology to be measured. We evaluate our approach through a large-scale real-life case study in biological data integration in which an integrated resource is constructed from three autononous proteomics data sources.},

  abstract = {Accurate and timely place-based information from multiple sources is essential for making informed social protection decisions and rapid interventions. Developing solutions to the challenges presented by multi-disciplanary data integration provides a rationale, and mechanisms, to realize the broader goals of Linked Data. The Spatial Identifier Reference Framework (SIRF) combines principles of indentifiers and Linked Data to link place names to related data. Unlike generic placename databases, SIRF uses semantic web technologies to describe relationships between sources of place names and exposes the provenance of identifiers to disambiuguate and explain them. This paper will describe how SIRF uses explicit information models of the spatial datasets from which it builds an index of spatial identifiers in use. Within the SIRF infrastructure the spatial identifiers are harvested from geospatial data sets and published as Web based identifiers (Uniform Resource Identifiers- URIs).

  abstract = {Marching along the DARPA SyNAPSE roadmap, IBM unveils a trilogy of innovations towards the True North cognitive computing system inspired by the brain's function andefficiency. Judiciously balancing the dual objectives of functional capability and implementation/operational cost, we develop asimple, digital, reconfigurable, versatile spiking neuron modelthat supports one-to-one equivalence between hardware andsimulation and is implementable using only 1272 ASIC gates. Starting with the classic leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, we add: (a) configurable and reproducible stochasticity to the input, thestate, and the output; (b) four leak modes that bias the internal state dynamics; (c) deterministic and stochastic thresholds; and(d) six reset modes for rich finite-state behavior. The model sup-ports a wide variety of computational functions and neural codes. We capture 50+ neuron behaviors in a library for hierarchical composition of complex computations and behaviors. Although designed with cognitive algorithms and applications in mind,serendipitously, the neuron model can qualitatively replicate the biologically-relevant behaviors of a dynamical neuron model.},

This book provides a concise introduction to the main research lines in this field, covering aspects such as preference modelling, uncertainty reasoning, social choice, stable matching, and computational aspects of preference aggregation and manipulation. The book is centered around the notion of preference reasoning, both in the single-agent and the multi-agent setting. It presents the main approaches to modeling and reasoning with preferences, with particular attention to two popular and powerful formalisms, soft constraints and CP-nets. The authors consider preference elicitation and various forms of uncertainty in soft constraints. They review the most relevant results in voting, with special attention to computational social choice. Finally, the book considers preferences in matching problems. The book is intended for students and researchers who may be interested in an introduction to preference reasoning and multi-agent preference aggregation, and who want to know the basic notions and results in computational social choice.},

Exploring this heterogeneous data by structured query languages is tedious and error-prone even for skilled users. To ease the task, this paper presents a methodology for translating natural language questions into structured SPARQL queries over linked-data sources.

Our method is based on an integer linear program to solve several disambiguation tasks jointly: the segmentation of questions into phrases; the mapping of phrases to semantic entities, classes, and relations; and the construction of SPARQL triple patterns. Our solution harnesses the rich type system provided by knowledge bases in the web of linked data, to constrain our semantic-coherence objective function. We present experiments on both the question translation and the resulting query answering.},

  abstract = {General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at runtime. (In other words, they don't know the rules until the game starts.) Unlike specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover such algorithms themselves. General game playing expertise depends on intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence of the programmer of the game player. GGP is an interesting application in its own right. It is intellectually engaging and more than a little fun. But it is much more than that. It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic systems and defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and resource bounds. It has practical applications in areas where these features are important, e.g., in business and law. More fundamentally, it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence. This book is an elementary introduction to General Game Playing (GGP). (1) It presents the theory of General Game Playing and leading GGP technologies. (2) It shows how to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs and humans. (3) It offers a glimpse of some of the real-world applications of General Game Playing.},

@article{glowalla2014processdriven,
  abstract = {Data quality is critical to organizational success. In order to improve and sustain data quality in the long term, process-driven data quality management (PDDQM) seeks to redesign processes that create or modify data. Consequently, process modeling is mandatory for PDDQM. Current research examines process modeling languages with respect to representational capabilities. However, there is a gap, since process modeling languages for PDDQM are not considered. We address this research gap by providing a synthesis of the varying applications of process modeling languages for PDDQM. We conducted a keyword-based literature review in conferences as well as 74 highranked information systems and computer science journals, reviewing 1,555 articles from 1995 onwards. For practitioners, it is possible to integrate the quality perspective within broadly applied process models. For further research, we derive representational requirements for PDDQM that should be integrated within existing process modeling languages. However, there is a need for further representational analysis to examine the adequacy of upcoming process modeling languages. New or enhanced process modeling languages may substitute for PDDQM-specific process modeling languages and facilitate development of a broadly applicable and accepted process modeling language for PDDQM.},

The field of LfD has grown into an extensive body of literature over the past 30 years, with a wide variety of approaches for encoding human demonstrations and modeling skills and tasks. Additionally, we have recently seen a focus on gathering data from nonexpert human teachers (i.e., domain experts but not robotics experts). In this book, we provide an introduction to the field with a focus on the unique technical challenges associated with designing robots that learn from naive human teachers. We begin, in the introduction, with a unification of the various terminology seen in the literature as well as an outline of the design choices one has in designing an LfD system. Chapter 2 gives a brief survey of the psychology literature that provides insights from human social learning that are relevant to designing robotic social learners. Chapter 3 walks through an LfD interaction, surveying the design choices one makes and state of the art approaches in prior work. First, is the choice of input, how the human teacher interacts with the robot to provide demonstrations. Next, is the choice of modeling technique. Currently, there is a dichotomy in the field between approaches that model low-level motor skills and those that model high-level tasks composed of primitive actions. We devote a chapter to each of these. Chapter 7 is devoted to interactive and active learning approaches that allow the robot to refine an existing task model. And finally, Chapter 8 provides best practices for evaluation of LfD systems, with a focus on how to approach experiments with human subjects in this domain.},

  abstract = {Data quality has emerged as an important and challenging topic in recent years. This article addresses the conceptual model quality as it has been widely accepted that better conceptual models produce better information systems and thus implicitly improve the data quality. Conceptual Models are designed as part of the analysis phase and serve as a communicating mediator between the users and the development team. Consequently, their understandability is a real challenge to avoid the propagation of inaccurate interpretation of the user requirements to the underlying system design and implementation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive quality model. We illustrate its usefulness by describing how it can be used to model and evaluate the understandability of conceptual models. Our quality evaluation is enriched with corrective actions provided to the designer, leading to a guidance modeling process. A first validation based on a survey is proposed.},

  abstract = {Cooperative game theory is a branch of (micro-)economics that studies the behavior of self-interested agents in strategic settings where binding agreements among agents are possible. Our aim in this book is to present a survey of work on the computational aspects of cooperative game theory. We begin by formally defining transferable utility games in characteristic function form, and introducing key solution concepts such as the core and the Shapley value. We then discuss two major issues that arise when considering such games from a computational perspective: identifying compact representations for games, and the closely related problem of efficiently computing solution concepts for games. We survey several formalisms for cooperative games that have been proposed in the literature, including, for example, cooperative games defined on networks, as well as general compact representation schemes such as MC-nets and skill games. As a detailed case study, we consider weighted voting games: a widely-used and practically important class of cooperative games that inherently have a natural compact representation. We investigate the complexity of solution concepts for such games, and generalizations of them. We briefly discuss games with non-transferable utility and partition function games. We then overview algorithms for identifying welfare-maximizing coalition structures and methods used by rational agents to form coalitions (even under uncertainty), including bargaining algorithms. We conclude by considering some developing topics, applications, and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Demographic aging, as a result of people living for longer, has put an increased burden on health and social care provision across most of the economies of the developed and developing world. In order to cope with the greater numbers of older people, together with increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, governments are looking to new ways to provide care and support to older people and their care providers. A growing trend is where health and social care providers are moving towards the use of assisted living technologies to provide care and assistance in the home. In this article, the research area of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems is examined and the data, information and the higher-level contextual knowledge quality issues in relation to these systems, is discussed. Lack of quality control may result in an AAL system providing assistance and support based upon incorrect data, information and knowledge inputs, and this may have a detrimental effect on the person making use of the system. We propose a model whereby contextual knowledge gained during the AAL system‚Äôs reasoning cycle can be fed back to aid in further quality checking at the various architectural layers, and a realistic AAL scenario is provided to support this. Future research should be conducted in these areas, with the requirement of building quality criteria into the design and implementation of AAL systems.},

These opinions are generally based solely on personal experience. We report a study to determine if programming educators form a consensus about which Java programming mistakes are the most common. We used the Blackbox data set to check whether the educators' opinions matched data from over 100,000 students - and checked whether this agreement was mediated by educators' experience. We found that educators formed only a weak consensus about which mistakes are most frequent, that their rankings bore only a moderate correspondence to the students in the Blackbox data, and that educators' experience had no effect on this level of agreement. These results raise questions about claims educators make regarding which errors students are most likely to commit.},

  abstract = {With the advent of XSEDE, the national cyberinfrastructure has evolved from a set of traditional HPC resources to a broader range of digital services. Science gateways, which serve as portals to scientific applications, have also evolved as researchers are dealing with rapidly expanding scientific datasets and the increasingly complex workflows. More and more gateways are being developed to support integrated services for running data-driven applications on HPC resources such as those on XSEDE. To facilitate this type of workflow, there is a pressing need for web-based data management systems that are easy to use, support data upload, sharing, access and management, and can be integrated with advanced computation and storage resources. More importantly such systems need to be accessible by users from the broad research and education communities. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of iData, a web-based community data publishing and sharing system. iData supports both generic file-based data collections and several commonly used environmental data collection formats including time series, GIS vector and raster data. Integrated data processing, visualization and filtering capabilities are provided for these data formats. Currently iData can be downloaded and deployed in a HUBzero-based gateway, and we plan to make it available for non-HUBzero platforms in the future. We present two examples in which iData has been successfully used to support research collaboration in driNET and GEOSHARE projects.},

@article{barnaghi2015challenges,
  abstract = {Smart cities use multimodal information coming from heterogeneous sources, including various types of the Internet of Things (IoT) data such as traffic, weather, pollution, and noise data. The smart city data usually have different quality of information (QoI). QoI of each data source mainly depends on three factors: (1) errors in measurements or precision of the data collection devices, (2) noise in the environment and quality of data communication and processing (including network-dependent quality of service parameters), and (3) granularity of the observations and measurements in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, various environments have different requirements that will determine the efficacy of using the data in the smart city applications; some systems have energy restrictions; and some wireless networks could rely on low bandwidth or intermittent connectivity. Most smart city applications also have to deal with huge volumes of data, with high velocity, dynamicity, and a variety of types of data. The QoI issues become more challenging when various data with different QoI are going to be integrated into an application to extract higher-level information and/or to provide actionable information to other services and applications. In some of the current smart city frameworks, the underlying information model is based on semantic descriptions that provide an annotation model to support interoperability between different sources of information (e.g., SmartSantander , Aarhus). These models can help to represent the QoI for each data source; however, the models and annotated data are often represented as static descriptions, making them unsuitable for dynamic smart city data in which the quality can change over time.},

  abstract = {In science, quality is paramount. As scientists increasingly look to the Web to share and discover scientific data, there is a growing need to support the scientist in assessing the quality of that data. However, quality is an ambiguous and overloaded term. In order to support the scientific user in discovering useful data we have systematically examined the nature of "quality" by exploiting three, prevalent properties of scientific data sets: (1) that data quality is commonly defined objectively; (2) the provenance and lineage in its production has a well understood role; and (3) "fitness-for-use" is a definition of utility rather than quality or trust, where the quality and trust-worthiness of the data and the entities that produced that data inform its utility. Our study is presented in two stages. First we review existing information quality dimensions and detail an assessment-oriented classification. We introduce definitions for quality, trust and utility in terms of the entities required in their assessment; producer, provider, consumer, process, artifact and quality standard. Next we detail a novel and experimental approach to assessment by modelling the causal relationships between quality, trust, and utility dimensions through the construction of decision networks informed by provenance graphs. To ground and motivate our discussion throughout we draw on the European Bioinformatics Institute's Gene Ontology Annotations database. We present an initial demonstration of our approach with an example for ranking results from the Gene Ontology Annotation database using an emerging objective quality measure, the Gene Ontology Annotation Quality score.},

Interoperability of these tools remains a technical challenge because of the heterogeneity of their models and access patterns. On the other side, quality analysts require more and more integration facilities that allow them to consolidate and aggregate multiple quality measures acquired from different observations or data sources, in using/combining seamlessly different quality tools. Clearly, there is a gap between users's requirements and the spatial data quality market. This demo paper will illustrate GQBox, a geographic quality (tool)box. GQBox supplies a standards-based generic meta model that supports the definition of quality goals and metrics, and it provides a service-based infrastructure that allows interoperability among several quality tools.},

  abstract = {Sensors are increasingly embedded into physical products in order to capture data about their conditions and usage for decision making in business applications. However, a major issue for such applications is the limited quality of the captured data due to inherently restricted precision and performance of the sensors. Moreover, the data quality is further decreased by data processing to meet resource constraints in streaming environments and ultimately influences business decisions. The issue of how to efficiently provide applications with information about data quality (DQ) is still an open research problem. In my Ph.D. thesis, I address this problem by developing a system to provide business applications with accurate information on data quality. Furthermore, the system will be able to incorporate and guarantee user-defined data quality levels. In this paper, I will present the major results from my research so far. This includes a novel jumping-window-based approach for the efficient transfer of data quality information as well as a flexible metamodel for storage and propagation of data quality. The comprehensive analysis of common data processing operators w.r.t. their impact on data quality allows a fruitful knowledge evaluation and thus diminishes incorrect business decisions.},

The target model, called Extended Three Valued Predicate Calculus (E3VPC), is largely based on a set of well-known mathematical concepts. The rules which allow the transformation of a general E3VPC expression to a Canonical Form, which can be manipulated using traditional, two-valued predicate calculus are also given; in this way, problems like equivalence analysis of SQL queries are completely solved. Finally, the fact that reasoning about the equivalence of SQL queries using two-valued predicate calculus, without taking care of the real SQL semantics can lead to errors is shown, and the reasons for this are analyzed.},

Even though the language is syntactically simple, relatively concise, and highly structured, students experience many difficulties while learning to express queries in SQL. In recent years a small number of software tools have been proposed to help students learn to write query statements and to assess their querying skills.

In this paper we compare and evaluate existing tools mainly from the perspective of database theory and practice, but also from a pedagogical perspective. Addressing the deficiencies and opportunities uncovered by the evaluation, we then introduce SQLify, a new tool that extends the current state of the art by incorporating semantic feedback, enhanced automatic assessment based on database theory, and peer review to arrive at a richer learning experience for students, as well as consistent assessment results and reduced marking for instructors.},

  abstract = {The growth of spatial big data has been explosive thanks to cost-effective and ubiquitous positioning technologies, and the generation of data from multiple sources in multi-forms. Such emerging spatial data has high potential to create new insights and values for our life through spatial analytics. However, spatial data analytics faces two major challenges. First, spatial data is both data-and compute-intensive due to the massive amounts of data and the multi-dimensional nature, which requires high performance spatial computing infrastructure and methods. Second, spatial big data sources are often isolated, for example, OpenStreetMap, census data and Twitter tweets are independent data sources. This leads to incompleteness of information and sometimes limited data accuracy, thus limited values from the data. Integrating spatial big data analytics by consolidating multiple data sources provides significant potential for data quality improvement in terms of completeness and accuracy, and much increased values derived from the data. In this paper, we present our vision of a high performance integrated spatial big data analytics framework. We provide a scalable spatial query based data integration engine with MapReduce, and demonstrate integrated spatial data analytics through a few use cases in our preliminary work. We then present our future plan on integrated spatial big data analytics for improving public health research and applications.},

In order to design information systems that deliver good quality of data, the notion of data quality has to be well-understood. However, there is still no consensus on what constitutes a good set of data quality dimensions and on appropriate definitions for each dimension.

We propose an ontologically-based approach to define data quality dimensions based on the role of an information systems as a representation of a real-world system. The dimensions are derived from possible failures of the representation. The analysis leads to four intrinsic dimensions of data quality: completeness, lack of ambiguity, meaningfulness, and correctness. We discuss the relationships of these dimensions to those cited in the literature and briefly present some implications of the analysis to information systems design.},

  abstract = {In a data-driven economy that struggles to cope with the volume and diversity of information, data quality assessment has become a necessary precursor to data analytics. Real-world data often contains inconsistencies, conflicts and errors. Such dirty data increases processing costs and has a negative impact on analytics. Assessing the quality of a dataset is especially important when a party is considering acquisition of data held by an untrusted entity. In this scenario, it is necessary to consider privacy risks of the stakeholders. This paper examines challenges in privacy-preserving data quality assessment. A two-party scenario is considered, consisting of a client that wishes to test data quality and a server that holds the dataset. Privacy-preserving protocols are presented for testing important data quality metrics: completeness, consistency, uniqueness, timeliness and validity. For semi-honest parties, the protocols ensure that the client does not discover any information about the data other than the value of the quality metric. The server does not discover the parameters of the client's query, the specific attributes being tested and the computed value of the data quality metric. The proposed protocols employ additively homomorphic encryption in conjunction with condensed data representations such as counting hash tables and histograms, serving as efficient alternatives to solutions based on private set intersection.},

  abstract = {The perception of data across organizations is changing. No longer is data just viewed as a secondary component of business.

Today information contained within a database is viewed by senior management and many departments as a critical factor in decision making, customer interaction and service delivery. In fact, 93 percent of companies believe data is essential to their marketing success. However, data quality inaccuracy leaves organizations at risk.

Unfortunately, the level of global inaccurate contact data has increased from 17 percent to 22 percent, up five percent in just 12 months.

With the increasing volume of information collected through a variety of channels, there is more room for human error. This combined with the prevalence of segmented, departmental approaches to data accuracy is preventing stakeholders from analyzing, improving and controlling data problems.

This year's study revealed that 66 percent of companies lack a coherent, centralized approach to data quality. But, ad-hoc approaches are dividing resources and further segmenting information.

Poor data quality is having a negative effect on budgets, marketing efforts and most importantly, customer satisfaction. Organizations that are not able to control the quality of their data are unable to effectively communicate with their customer base.

Data quality is the foundation for any data-driven effort and in order to succeed in the year ahead, organizations will need to look at prioritizing data accuracy and accessibility.},

  abstract = {The efficient operation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems largely depends on data quality. ERP can improve data quality and information sharing within an organization. It can also pose challenges to data quality. While it is well known that data quality is important in ERP systems, most existing research has focused on identifying the factors affecting the implementation and the business values of ERP. With normal accident theory as a theoretical lens, we examine data quality problems in ERP using a case study of a large, fast-growing multinational manufacturer headquartered in China. Our findings show that organizations that have successfully implemented ERP can still experience certain data quality problems. We identify major data quality problems in data production, storage and maintenance, and utilization processes. We also analyze the causes of these data quality problems by linking them to certain characteristics of ERP systems within an organizational context. Our analysis shows that problems resulting from the tight coupling effects and the complexity of ERP-enabled manufacturing systems can be inevitable. This study will help researchers and practitioners formulate data management strategies that are effective in the presence of certain ‚Äúnormal‚Äù data quality problems.},

I believe we neglect data quality at our peril since - whether we like it or not - our research results are founded upon data and our assumptions that data quality issues do not confound our results. A systematic review of the literature suggests that it is a minority practice to even explicitly discuss data quality. I therefore suggest that this topic should become a higher priority amongst empirical software engineering researchers.},

@article{mhuner2011product,
  abstract = {A number of business requirements (e.g. compliance with regulatory and legal provisions, diffusion of global standards, supply chain integration) are forcing consumer goods manufacturers to increase their efforts to provide product data (e.g. product identifiers, dimensions) at business-to-business interfaces timely and accurately. The quality of such data is a critical success factor for efficient and effective cross-company collaboration. If compliance relevant data (e.g. dangerous goods indicators) is missing or false, consumer goods manufacturers risk being fined and see their company's image damaged. Or if logistics data (e.g. product dimensions, gross weight) is inaccurate or provided not in time, business with key account trading partners is endangered. To be able to manage the risk of business critical data defects, companies must be able to a) identify such data defects, and b) specify and use metrics that allow to monitor the data's quality. As scientific research on both these issues has come up with only few results so far, this case study explores the process of identifying business critical product data defects at German consumer goods manufacturing company Beiersdorf AG. Despite advanced data quality management structures such defects still occur and can result in complaints, service level impairment and avoidable costs. The case study analyzes product data use and maintenance in Beiersdorf's ecosystem, identifies typical product data defects, and proposes a set of data quality metrics for monitoring those defects.},

@inproceedings{thakkar2007qualitydriven,
  abstract = {Accurate and efficient integration of geospatial data is an important problem with applications in areas such as emergency response and urban planning. Some of the key challenges in supporting large-scale geospatial data integration are automatically computing the quality of the data provided by a large number of geospatial sources and dynamically providing high quality answers to the user queries based on a quality criteria supplied by the user. We describe a framework called the Quality-driven Geospatial Mediator (QGM) that supports efficient and accurate integration of geospatial data from a large number of sources. The key contributions of our framework are: (1) the ability to automatically estimate the quality of data provided by a source by using the information from another source of known quality, (2) representing the quality of data provided by the sources in a declarative data integration framework, and (3) a query answering technique that exploits the quality information to provide high quality geospatial data in response to user queries. Our experimental evaluation using over 1200 real-world sources shows that QGM can accurately estimate the quality of geospatial sources. Moreover, QGM provides better quality data in response to the user queries compared to the traditional data integration systems and does so with lower response time.},

@book{mahadevan2008representation,
  abstract = {Representations are at the heart of artificial intelligence (AI). This book is devoted to the problem of representation discovery: how can an intelligent system construct representations from its experience? Representation discovery re-parameterizes the state space - prior to the application of information retrieval, machine learning, or optimization techniques - facilitating later inference processes by constructing new task-specific bases adapted to the state space geometry. This book presents a general approach to representation discovery using the framework of harmonic analysis, in particular Fourier and wavelet analysis. Biometric compression methods, the compact disc, the computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner in medicine, JPEG compression, and spectral analysis of time-series data are among the many applications of classical Fourier and wavelet analysis. A central goal of this book is to show that these analytical tools can be generalized from their usual setting in (infinite-dimensional) Euclidean spaces to discrete (finite-dimensional) spaces typically studied in many subfields of AI. Generalizing harmonic analysis to discrete spaces poses many challenges: a discrete representation of the space must be adaptively acquired; basis functions are not pre-defined, but rather must be constructed. Algorithms for efficiently computing and representing bases require dealing with the curse of dimensionality. However, the benefits can outweigh the costs, since the extracted basis functions outperform parametric bases as they often reflect the irregular shape of a particular state space. Case studies from computer graphics, information retrieval, machine learning, and state space planning are used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed framework, and the challenges that remain to be addressed. Representation discovery is an actively developing field, and the author hopes this book will encourage other researchers to explore this exciting area of research.},

In this paper, we explore data quality assurance practices in River Watch, a community-based monitoring program in the Red River basin. We investigate how the participants in River Watch understand and prioritize data quality concerns. We found that data quality in River Watch is primarily maintained through universal adherence to standard operating procedures, but there remain areas where technological intervention may help. We also found that rigorous data quality assurance practices appear to enhance rather than hinder the educational goals of the program. We draw implications for the design of quality assurance mechanisms for River Watch and other citizen science projects.},

@article{cure2012improving,
  abstract = {Many health care systems and services exploit drug related information stored in databases. The poor data quality of these databases, e.g. inaccuracy of drug contraindications, can lead to catastrophic consequences for the health condition of patients. Hence it is important to ensure their quality in terms of data completeness and soundness. In the database domain, standard Functional Dependencies (FDs) and INclusion Dependencies (INDs), have been proposed to prevent the insertion of incorrect data. But they are generally not expressive enough to represent a domain-specific set of constraints. To this end, conditional dependencies, i.e. standard dependencies extended with tableau patterns containing constant values, have been introduced and several methods have been proposed for their discovery and representation. The quality of drug databases can be considerably improved by their usage. Moreover, pharmacology information is inherently hierarchical and many standards propose graph structures to represent them, e.g. the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) or OpenGalen‚Äôs terminology. In this article, we emphasize that the technologies of the Semantic Web are adapted to represent these hierarchical structures, i.e. in RDFS and OWL. We also present a solution for representing conditional dependencies using a query language defined for these graph oriented structures, namely SPARQL. The benefits of this approach are interoperability with applications and ontologies of the Semantic Web as well as a reasoning-based query execution solution to clean underlying databases.},

@techreport{loshin2011busting,
  abstract = {Even though great strides have been made in data quality improvement over the past decades, many myths and misconceptions are perpetuated through popular articles and presentations. Often, these simplified views can be confusing or conflicting, and those blindly accepting the statements may find their attempts at making discrete progress toward improvement may slow and stall. The goal of this paper is to highlight some common ``myths'' about data quality management, explain why these are myths, and to guide the reader to make better choices when deciding to pursue a data quality management strategy.

 Adding critical insight into different aspects of data quality management and putting some common beliefs into perspective will help you put together a more thoughtful plan for a data quality management program that can lead to measurable improvements in the quality and usability of organizational data. There are no substitutes for good data management disciplines, and this paper will advise the practitioner as to what the critical data issues are in the organization and how to leverage the right tools and technologies to address those issues in the most efficient way.

 Defining and deploying well-¬≠‚Äêdefined processes within a culture of data governance will simplify technology acquisition and reduce time to value for implementing a data quality program. Our intent is to provide a balanced view of the best practices for data quality improvement by examining some common statements that can help differentiate what you heard, why it may be a myth, and some considerations to planning your approach to data quality improvement.},

In this empirical study, we focus on data consistency as a critical factor influencing the accuracy of prediction models in software engineering. We propose a software metric called Cases Inconsistency Level (CIL) for analyzing conflicts within software engineering data sets by leveraging probability statistics on project cases and counting the number of conflicting pairs. The result demonstrated that CIL is able to be used as a metric to identify either consistent data sets or inconsistent data sets, which are valuable for building robust prediction models. In addition to measuring the level of consistency, CIL is proved to be applicable to predict whether or not an effort model built from data set can achieve higher accuracy, an important indicator for empirical experiments in software engineering.},

This data holds promise for use in software engineering research. We combined data from 109 industrial projects into a database to support performance benchmarking and model development. But is the data of sufficient quality to draw conclusions? We applied various tests and techniques to identify data anomalies that affect the quality of the data in several dimensions. In this paper, we report some initial results of our analysis, describing the amount and the rates of identified anomalies and suspect data, including incorrectness, inconsistency, and credibility. To illustrate the types of data available for analysis, we provide three examples. The preliminary results of this empirical study suggest that some aspects of the data quality are good and the data are generally credible, but size data are often missing.},

  abstract = {Marching along the DARPA SyNAPSE roadmap, IBM unveils a trilogy of innovations towards the TrueNorth cognitive computing system inspired by the brain's functionand efficiency. The sequential programming paradigm of thevon Neumann architecture is wholly unsuited for TrueNorth. Therefore, as our main contribution, we develop a new programming paradigm that permits construction of complex cognitive algorithms and applications while being efficient for TrueNorth and effective for programmer productivity. The programming paradigm consists of (a) an abstraction for a TrueNorth program, named Corelet, for representing a network of neurosynaptic cores that encapsulates all details except external inputs andoutputs; (b) an object-oriented Corelet Language for creating, composing, and decomposing corelets; (c) a Corelet Library that acts as an ever-growing repository of reusable corelets from which programmers compose new corelets; and (d) an end-to-end Corelet Laboratory that is a programming environment whichintegrates with the TrueNorth architectural simulator, Compass, to support all aspects of the programming cycle from design,through development, debugging, and up to deployment. Thenew paradigm seamlessly scales from a handful of synapses andneurons to networks of neurosynaptic cores of progressively increasing size and complexity. The utility of the new programming paradigm is underscored by the fact that we have designed and implemented more than 100 algorithms as corelets for TrueNorth in a very short time span.},

It has been the target of research and development for over 4 decades by business analysts, solution architects, database experts and statisticians to name a few. However, the changing landscape of data quality challenges indicate the need for holistic solutions. As a first step towards bridging any gaps between the various research communities, we undertook a comprehensive literature study of data quality research published in the last two decades. In this study we considered a broad range of Information System (IS) and Computer Science (CS) publication (conference and journal) outlets. The main aims of the study were to understand the current landscape of data quality research, to create better awareness of (lack of) synergies between various research communities, and, subsequently, to direct attention towards holistic solutions. In this paper, we present a summary of the findings from the study, that include a taxonomy of data quality problems, identification of the top themes, outlets and main trends in data quality research, as well as a detailed thematic analysis that outlines the overlaps and distinctions between the focus of IS and CS publications.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the data quality issues that emerge when training a shrinkage-based classifier with noisy data. A statistical text analysis technique based on a shrinkage-based variation of multinomial naive Bayes is applied to a set of free-text discharge diagnoses occurring in a number of hospitalizations. All of these diagnoses were previously coded according to the Spanish Edition of ICD9-CM. We deal with the issue of analyzing the predictive power and robustness of the statistical machine learning algorithm proposed for ICD-9-CM classification. We explore the effect of training the models using both clean and noisy data. In particular our work investigates the extent to which errors in free-text diagnoses propagate to the classification model. A measure of predictive accuracy is calculated for the text classification algorithm under analysis. Subsequently, the quality of the sample data is incrementally deteriorated by simulating errors in the text and/or codes. The predictive accuracy is recomputed for each of the noisy samples for comparison purposes. Our research shows that the shrinkage-based classifier is a valid alternative to automate ICD9-CM coding even under circumstances in which the quality of the training data is in question.},

  abstract = { Abstract:Poor data quality (DQ) can have substantial social and economic impacts. Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers.A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context ofthe task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer.Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers‚Äô data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers‚Äô experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework. },

Oftentimes, the rules, which are related to the business logic, can only be defined on some target report generated by transformations over multiple data sources. This creates a situation where the violations detected in the report are decoupled in space and time from the actual source of errors. In addition, applying the repair on the report would need to be repeated whenever the data sources change. Finally, even if repairing the report is possible and affordable, this would be of little help towards identifying and analyzing the actual sources of errors for future prevention of violations at the target. In this paper, we propose a system to address this decoupling. The system takes quality rules defined over the output of a transformation and computes explanations of the errors seen on the output. This is performed both at the target level to describe these errors and at the source level to prescribe actions to solve them. We present scalable techniques to detect, propagate, and explain errors. We also study the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques using the TPC-H Benchmark for different scenarios and classes of quality rules.},

  abstract = {Many researchers and practitioners have been attracted to improve data quality due to its monumental importance as a key success factor. Mathematical and statistical models have been deployed to information systems to introduce constrain and transaction based mechanisms to prevent data quality related problems. Entire management of the process and roles involved in data generation has also been scrutinized. Vast amount of knowledge base has been progressed in this area; however, most of the approaches are limited from practical perspective. System development process incorporating quality modelling is rarely integrated. Quality related meta data is absent from most information system. Neither process mapping nor data modelling provides sufficient provision to measure quality or certification of data in the information systems. Furthermore, ongoing monitoring of data for quality conformance through a separate process is expensive and time consuming. Recognising this limitation and aiming to provide a practical-orient comprehensive approach, we propose a process centric quality focused system design incorporating data product quality, conformance monitoring and certification. In this paper we focus on the self certification of data quality based on our earlier work on the process centric framework for ongoing data quality monitoring.},

  abstract = {Currently available data quality tools provide development environments that significantly decrease the effort in dealing with common data problems, such as those related with attribute domain validation, syntax checking, or value matching against a reference master data repository. On the contrary, more complex and specific data quality functionalities, whose requirements usually derive from application domain business rules, have to be developed from scratch, usually leading to high costs of development and maintenance. This paper introduces the concept of inheritance in a metadata-driven approach to simplified data quality rule management. The approach is based on the belief that even complex data quality rules very often adhere to recurring patterns that can be encoded and encapsulated as reusable, abstract templates. The approach is supported by a metamodel developed on top of OMG's Common Warehouse Metamodel, herein extended with the ability to derive new rule patterns from existing ones, through inheritance. The inheritance metamodel is presented in UML and its application is illustrated with a running example.},

@inproceedings{bosu2013quality,
  abstract = {Context: The utility of prediction models in empirical software engineering (ESE) is heavily reliant on the quality of the data used in building those models. Several data quality challenges such as noise, incompleteness, outliers and duplicate data points may be relevant in this regard. Objective: We investigate the reporting of three potentially influential elements of data quality in ESE studies: data collection, data pre-processing, and the identification of data quality issues. This enables us to establish how researchers view the topic of data quality and the mechanisms that are being used to address it. Greater awareness of data quality should inform both the sound conduct of ESE research and the robust practice of ESE data collection and processing. Method: We performed a targeted literature review of empirical software engineering studies covering the period January 2007 to September 2012. A total of 221 relevant studies met our inclusion criteria and were characterized in terms of their consideration and treatment of data quality. Results: We obtained useful insights as to how the ESE community considers these three elements of data quality. Only 23 of these 221 studies reported on all three elements of data quality considered in this paper. Conclusion: The reporting of data collection procedures is not documented consistently in ESE studies. It will be useful if data collection challenges are reported in order to improve our understanding of why there are problems with software engineering data sets and the models developed from them. More generally, data quality should be given far greater attention by the community. The improvement of data sets through enhanced data collection, pre-processing and quality assessment should lead to more reliable prediction models, thus improving the practice of software engineering.},

Many scientific discovery processes consume data from a diverse array of resources such as streaming sensor networks, web services, and databases. The validity of a scientific computation's results is highly dependent on the quality of these input data. Scientific workflow systems are being increasingly used to automate scientific computations by facilitating experiment design, data capture, integration, processing, and analysis. These workflows may execute in grid or cloud environments, and if the data produced during workflow execution is deemed unusable or low in quality, execution should stop to prevent wasting these valuable resources. We propose an approach in the Kepler scientific workflow system for monitoring data quality and demonstrate its use for oceanography and bioinformatics domains.},

@book{mausam2012planning,
  abstract = {Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are widely popular in Artificial Intelligence for modeling sequential decision-making scenarios with probabilistic dynamics. They are the framework of choice when designing an intelligent agent that needs to act for long periods of time in an environment where its actions could have uncertain outcomes. MDPs are actively researched in two related subareas of AI, probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning. Probabilistic planning assumes known models for the agent's goals and domain dynamics, and focuses on determining how the agent should behave to achieve its objectives. On the other hand, reinforcement learning additionally learns these models based on the feedback the agent gets from the environment. This book provides a concise introduction to the use of MDPs for solving probabilistic planning problems, with an emphasis on the algorithmic perspective. It covers the whole spectrum of the field, from the basics to state-of-the-art optimal and approximation algorithms. We first describe the theoretical foundations of MDPs and the fundamental solution techniques for them. We then discuss modern optimal algorithms based on heuristic search and the use of structured representations. A major focus of the book is on the numerous approximation schemes for MDPs that have been developed in the AI literature. These include determinization-based approaches, sampling techniques, heuristic functions, dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical representations. Finally, we briefly introduce several extensions of the standard MDP classes that model and solve even more complex planning problems.},

@book{bazzan2014introduction,
  abstract = {Urban mobility is not only one of the pillars of modern economic systems, but also a key issue in the quest for equality of opportunity, once it can improve access to other services. Currently, however, there are a number of negative issues related to traffic, especially in mega-cities, such as economical issues (cost of opportunity caused by delays), environmental (externalities related to emissions of pollutants), and social (traffic accidents). Solutions to these issues are more and more closely tied to information and communication technology. Indeed, a search in the technical literature (using the keyword "urban traffic" to filter out articles on data network traffic) retrieved the following number of articles (as of December 3, 2013): 9,443 (ACM Digital Library), 26,054 (Scopus), and 1,730,000 (Google Scholar). Moreover, articles listed in the ACM query relate to conferences as diverse as MobiCom, CHI, PADS, and AAMAS. This means that there is a big and diverse community of computer scientists and computer engineers who tackle research that is connected to the development of intelligent traffic and transportation systems. It is also possible to see that this community is growing, and that research projects are getting more and more interdisciplinary. To foster the cooperation among the involved communities, this book aims at giving a broad introduction into the basic but relevant concepts related to transportation systems, targeting researchers and practitioners from computer science and information technology. In addition, the second part of the book gives a panorama of some of the most exciting and newest technologies, originating in computer science and computer engineering, that are now being employed in projects related to car-to-car communication, interconnected vehicles, car navigation, platooning, crowd sensing and sensor networks, among others. This material will also be of interest to engineers and researchers from the traffic and transportation community.},

@article{stahl2013translating,
  abstract = {Translating Euclid reports on an effort to transform geometry for students from a stylus-and-clay-tablet corpus of historical theorems to a stimulating computer-supported collaborative-learning inquiry experience.

The origin of geometry was a turning point in the pre-history of informatics, literacy, and rational thought. Yet, this triumph of human intellect became ossified through historic layers of systematization, beginning with Euclid‚Äôs organization of the Elements of geometry. Often taught by memorization of procedures, theorems, and proofs, geometry in schooling rarely conveys its underlying intellectual excitement. The recent development of dynamic-geometry software offers an opportunity to translate the study of geometry into a contemporary vernacular. However, this involves transformations along multiple dimensions of the conceptual and practical context of learning.

Translating Euclid steps through the multiple challenges involved in redesigning geometry education to take advantage of computer support. Networked computers portend an interactive approach to exploring dynamic geometry as well as broadened prospects for collaboration. The proposed conception of geometry emphasizes the central role of the construction of dependencies as a design activity, integrating human creation and mathematical discovery to form a human-centered approach to mathematics.

This book chronicles an iterative effort to adapt technology, theory, pedagogy and practice to support this vision of collaborative dynamic geometry and to evolve the approach through on-going cycles of trial with students and refinement of resources. It thereby provides a case study of a design-based research effort in computer-supported collaborative learning from a human-centered informatics perspective.

Using economic and business theory a range of concepts are explored which include a brief review of existing business structures related to the exchange of goods, data or otherwise. The paper calls for a wider discussion by the Web Observatory community to begin to define relevant criteria by which data can be assessed and improved over time. The economic incentives are addressed as part of a price by proxy framework we introduce, which is supported by the need to strive for clear pricing signals and the reduction of information asymmetries. What is presented here is a way of establishing and improving data quality with a view to valuing data exchanges that does not require the presence of money in the transaction, yet it remains tied to revenue generation models as they exist online.},

@article{blake2011effects,
  abstract = {Data quality remains a persistent problem in practice and a challenge for research. In this study we focus on the four dimensions of data quality noted as the most important to information consumers, namely accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. These dimensions are of particular concern for operational systems, and most importantly for data warehouses, which are often used as the primary data source for analyses such as classification, a general type of data mining. However, the definitions and conceptual models of these dimensions have not been collectively considered with respect to data mining in general or classification in particular. Nor have they been considered for problem complexity. Conversely, these four dimensions of data quality have only been indirectly addressed by data mining research. Using definitions and constructs of data quality dimensions, our research evaluates the effects of both data quality and problem complexity on generated data and tests the results in a real-world case. Six different classification outcomes selected from the spectrum of classification algorithms show that data quality and problem complexity have significant main and interaction effects. From the findings of significant effects, the economics of higher data quality are evaluated for a frequent application of classification and illustrated by the real-world case.},

  abstract = {Information quality (IQ) is a measure of how fit information is for a purpose. Sometimes called Quality of Information (QoI) by analogy with Quality of Service (QoS), it quantifies whether the correct information is being used to make a decision or take an action. Not understanding when information is of adequate quality can lead to bad decisions and catastrophic effects, including system outages, increased costs, lost revenue -- and worse. Quantifying information quality can help improve decision making, but the ultimate goal should be to select or construct information producers that have the appropriate balance between information quality and the cost of providing it. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to the field, argue the case for applying information quality metrics in the systems domain, and propose a research agenda to explore this space.},

These impacts include customer dissatisfaction, increased operational cost, less effective decision-making and a reduced ability to make and execute strategy. More subtly perhaps, poor data quality hurts employee morale, breeds organizational mistrust, and makes it more difficult to align the enterprise. Creating awareness of a problem and its impact is a critical first step towards resolution of the problem. The needed awareness of the poor data quality, while growing, has not yet been achieved in many enterprises. After all, the typical executive is already besieged by too many problems, low customer satisfaction, high costs, a data warehouse project that is late, and so forth. Creating awareness of issues of the accuracy level and impacts within the enterprise is the first obstacle that practitioners must overcome when implementing data quality programs.},

  abstract = {This book conveys the fundamentals of Linked Lexical Knowledge Bases (LLKB) and sheds light on their different aspects from various perspectives, focusing on their construction and use in natural language processing (NLP). It characterizes a wide range of both expert-based and collaboratively constructed lexical knowledge bases. Only basic familiarity with NLP is required and this book has been written for both students and researchers in NLP and related fields who are interested in knowledge-based approaches to language analysis and their applications.

Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKBs) are indispensable in many areas of natural language processing, as they encode human knowledge of language in machine readable form, and as such, they are required as a reference when machines attempt to interpret natural language in accordance with human perception. In recent years, numerous research efforts have led to the insight that to make the best use of available knowledge, the orchestrated exploitation of different LKBs is necessary. This allows us to not only extend the range of covered words and senses, but also gives us the opportunity to obtain a richer knowledge representation when a particular meaning of a word is covered in more than one resource. Examples where such an orchestrated usage of LKBs proved beneficial include word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, semantic parsing, and text classification.

This book presents different kinds of automatic, manual, and collaborative linkings between LKBs. A special chapter is devoted to the linking algorithms employing text-based, graph-based, and joint modeling methods. Following this, it presents a set of higher-level NLP tasks and algorithms, effectively utilizing the knowledge in LLKBs. Among them, you will find advanced methods, e.g., distant supervision, or continuous vector space models of knowledge bases (KB), that have become widely used at the time of this book's writing. Finally, multilingual applications of LLKB's, such as cross-lingual semantic relatedness and computer-aided translation are discussed, as well as tools and interfaces for exploring LLKBs, followed by conclusions and future research directions.

interface with structured knowledge bases. In the second part of this survey,
we review the datasets available for training and evaluating VQA systems. The
various datatsets contain questions at different levels of complexity, which
require different capabilities and types of reasoning. We examine in depth the
question/answer pairs from the Visual Genome project, and evaluate the
relevance of the structured annotations of images with scene graphs for VQA.
Finally, we discuss promising future directions for the field, in particular
the connection to structured knowledge bases and the use of natural language

@article{shasha2008statistics,
  abstract = {Statistics is the activity of inferring results about a population given a sample. Historically, statistics books assume an underlying distribution to the data (typically, the normal distribution) and derive results under that assumption. Unfortunately, in real life, one cannot normally be sure of the underlying distribution. For that reason, this book presents a distribution-independent approach to statistics based on a simple computational counting idea called resampling.

This book explains the basic concepts of resampling, then systematically presents the standard statistical measures along with programs (in the language Python) to calculate them using resampling, and finally illustrates the use of the measures and programs in a case study. The text uses junior high school algebra and many examples to explain the concepts. The ideal reader has mastered at least elementary mathematics, likes to think procedurally, and is comfortable with computers.

  abstract = {In declarative data cleaning, data semantics are encoded as constraints and errors arise when the data violates the constraints. Various forms of statistical and logical inference can be used to reason about and repair inconsistencies (errors) in data. Recently, unified approaches that repair both errors in data and errors in semantics (the constraints) have been proposed. However, both data-only approaches and unified approaches are by and large static in that they apply cleaning to a single snapshot of the data and constraints. We introduce a continuous data cleaning framework that can be applied to dynamic data and constraint environments. Our approach permits both the data and its semantics to evolve and suggests repairs based on the accumulated evidence to date. Importantly, our approach uses not only the data and constraints as evidence, but also considers the past repairs chosen and applied by a user (user repair preferences). We introduce a repair classifier that predicts the type of repair needed to resolve an inconsistency, and that learns from past user repair preferences to recommend more accurate repairs in the future. Our evaluation shows that our techniques achieve high prediction accuracy and generate high quality repairs. Of independent interest, our work makes use of a set of data statistics that are shown to be sensitive to predicting particular repair types.},

  abstract = {New data acquisition techniques are emerging and are providing fast and efficient means for multidimensional spatial data collection. Airborne LIDAR surveys, SAR satellites, stereo-photogrammetry and mobile mapping systems are increasingly used for the digital reconstruction of the environment. All these systems provide extremely high volumes of raw data, often enriched with other sensor data (e.g., beam intensity). Improving methods to process and visually analyze this massive amount of geospatial and user-generated data is crucial to increase the efficiency of organizations and to better manage societal challenges.

Within this context, this book proposes an up-to-date view of computational methods and tools for spatio-temporal data fusion, multivariate surface generation, and feature extraction, along with their main applications for surface approximation and rainfall analysis. The book is intended to attract interest from different fields, such as computer vision, computer graphics, geomatics, and remote sensing, working on the common goal of processing 3D data. To this end, it presents and compares methods that process and analyze the massive amount of geospatial data in order to support better management of societal challenges through more timely and better decision making, independent of a specific data modeling paradigm (e.g., 2D vector data, regular grids or 3D point clouds).

We also show how current research is developing from the traditional layered approach, adopted by most GIS softwares, to intelligent methods for integrating existing data sets that might contain important information on a geographical area and environmental phenomenon. These services combine traditional map-oriented visualization with fully 3D visual decision support methods and exploit semantics-oriented information (e.g., a-priori knowledge, annotations, segmentations) when processing, merging, and integrating big pre-existing data sets.

  abstract = {
Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to facilitate understanding of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and data quality interdependency by presenting ERP systems‚Äô use within data quality management.

Design/methodology/approach -- The authors apply task technology fit (TTF) in an explorative study, conducting semi-structured expert interviews with participants in information technology strategic decision making. The authors analyzed the interviews with iterative descriptive and subsequent interpretive coding.

Findings -- Although considered sustainable, continuously increasing regulations challenge ERP systems. However, compliance with regulations may serve as a bridge for organizations to engage in data analysis. Organizations are embedded into evolving task environments with the need to continuously adapt their systems or the organization and the need for contextual understanding of data quality.

Research limitations/implications -- With ERP systems being used for administrative functions, future research might draw on extant ERP systems research from the manufacturing sector. However, for insurance-specific tasks, ERP systems and their data need to be considered in a sector-specific context with the need for further research.

Practical implications -- ERP systems are considered sustainable. High initial fit is desirable, but the sector‚Äôs relevance for ERP system vendors might be more important for sustainability. Ensuring TTF will be an increasing challenge with increasing task non-routineness.

Originality/value -- Applying TTF provides guidance for fit research, while the qualitative approach accounts for a deeper understanding, especially when exploring data quality issues since deficiencies might have several root causes. The authors show that ERP systems have an impact on data quality beyond its typically examined functionality

@inproceedings{almeida2012ontologies,
  abstract = {The emergence of new business models, namely, the establishment of partnerships between organizations, the chance that companies have of adding existing data on the web, especially in the semantic web, to their information, led to the emphasis on some problems existing in databases, particularly related to data quality. Poor data can result in loss of competitiveness of the organizations holding these data, and may even lead to their disappearance, since many of their decision-making processes are based on these data. For this reason, data cleaning is essential. Current approaches to solve these problems are closely linked to database schemas and specific domains. In order that data cleaning can be used in different repositories, it is necessary for computer systems to understand these data, i.e., an associated semantic is needed. The solution presented in this paper includes the use of ontologies: (i) for the specification of data cleaning operations and, (ii) as a way of solving the semantic heterogeneity problems of data stored in different sources. With data cleaning operations defined at a conceptual level and existing mappings between domain ontologies and an ontology that results from a database, they may be instantiated and proposed to the expert/specialist to be executed over that database, thus enabling their interoperability.},

  abstract = {Organisations are facing ever more diverse challenges in managing their enterprise systems as emerging technologies bring both added complexities as well as opportunities to the way they conduct their business. Underpinning this ever-increasing volatility is the importance of having quality data to provide information to make those important enterprise-wide decisions. Numerous studies suggest that many organisations are not paying enough attention to their data and that a major cause of this is their failure to measure its quality and value and/or evaluate the costs of having poor data. This study proposes an integrated framework that organisations can adopt as part of their financial and management control processes to provide a mechanism for quantifying data problems, costing potential solutions and monitoring the on-going costs and benefits, to assist them in improving and then sustaining the quality of their data.},

This is an important area of research as it could save many computation cycles and thus allow accurate information provided to the right people at the right time. Two considerations when forming a data warehouse are data cleansing (including entity resolution) and with schema integration (including record linkage). Uncleansed and fragmented data requires time to decipher and may lead to increased costs for an organization, so data cleansing and schema integration can save a great many (human) computation cycles and can lead to higher organizational efficiency. In this study we survey the literature for the methodologies proposed or developed for entity resolution and record linkage.

It begins with the fundamentals of mathematics of matrices and determinants. Matrix inversion is discussed, with an introduction of the well known reduction methods. Equation sets are viewed as vector transformations, and the conditions of their solvability are explored. Orthogonal matrices are introduced with examples showing application to many problems requiring three dimensional thinking. The angular velocity matrix is shown to emerge from the differentiation of the 3-D orthogonal matrix, leading to the discussion of particle and rigid body dynamics.

The book continues with the eigenvalue problem and its application to multi-variable vibrations. Because the eigenvalue problem requires some operations with polynomials, a separate discussion of these is given in an appendix. The example of the vibrating string is given with a comparison of the matrix analysis to the continuous solution.

  abstract = {Modern organizations offer services through multiple channels, such as branches, ATMs, telephones, and Internet sites, and are supported by multifunctional software architectures. Different functional modules share data, which are typically stored in multiple local databases. Functional modules are usually not integrated across channels, as channels are implemented at different times within independent software projects and are subject to varying requirements of availability and performance. This lack of channel and functional integration raises data quality problems that can impact the quality of the products and services of an organization. In particular, in complex systems in which data are managed in multiple databases, timeliness is critical. This paper focuses on time-related factors of data quality and provides a model that can help companies to evaluate data currency, accuracy, and completeness in software architectures with different degrees of integration across channels and functionalities. The model is validated through simulation based on empirical data on financial information systems. Results indicate how architectural choices on the degree of data integration have a varying impact on currency, accuracy, and completeness depending on the type of financial institution and on customer profiles.},

  abstract = {Quantitative Data Cleaning (QDC) is the use of statistical and other analytical techniques to detect, quantify, and correct data quality problems (or glitches). Current QDC approaches focus on addressing each category of data glitch individually. However, in real-world data, different types of data glitches co-occur in complex patterns. These patterns and interactions between glitches offer valuable clues for developing effective domain-specific quantitative cleaning strategies. In this paper, we address the shortcomings of the extant QDC methods by proposing a novel framework, the DEC (Detect-Explore-Clean) framework. It is a comprehensive approach for the definition, detection and cleaning of complex, multi-type data glitches. We exploit the distributions and interactions of different types of glitches to develop data-driven cleaning strategies that may offer significant advantages over blind strategies. The DEC framework is a statistically rigorous methodology for evaluating and scoring glitches and selecting the quantitative cleaning strategies that result in cleaned data sets that are statistically proximal to user specifications. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the DEC framework on very large real-world and synthetic data sets.},

In this tutorial, we highlight the substantial challenges that the first three `V's, volume, velocity and variety, bring to dealing with veracity in big data. Due to the sheer volume and velocity of data, one needs to understand and (possibly) repair erroneous data in a scalable and timely manner. With the variety of data, often from a diversity of sources, data quality rules cannot be specified a priori; one needs to let the &#x201C;data to speak for itself&#x201D; in order to discover the semantics of the data.

  abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) went through a profound transformation in the mid-1980s when it shifted to make heavy use of corpora and data-driven techniques to analyze language. Since then, the use of statistical techniques in NLP has evolved in several ways. One such example of evolution took place in the late 1990s or early 2000s, when full-fledged Bayesian machinery was introduced to NLP. This Bayesian approach to NLP has come to accommodate for various shortcomings in the frequentist approach and to enrich it, especially in the unsupervised setting, where statistical learning is done without target prediction examples.

We cover the methods and algorithms that are needed to fluently read Bayesian learning papers in NLP and to do research in the area. These methods and algorithms are partially borrowed from both machine learning and statistics and are partially developed "in-house" in NLP. We cover inference techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference, Bayesian estimation, and nonparametric modeling. We also cover fundamental concepts in Bayesian statistics such as prior distributions, conjugacy, and generative modeling. Finally, we cover some of the fundamental modeling techniques in NLP, such as grammar modeling and their use with Bayesian analysis.

The same data resource may have an acceptable level of quality for some contexts but this quality may be unacceptable for other contexts. However, existing data quality metrics are mostly derived impartially, disconnected from the specific contextual characteristics. This study argues for the need to revise data quality metrics and measurement techniques to incorporate and better reflect contextual assessment. It contributes to that end by developing new metrics for assessing data quality along commonly used dimensions - completeness, validity, accuracy, and currency. The metrics are driven by data utility, a conceptual measure of the business value that is associated with the data within a specific usage context. The suggested data quality measurement framework uses utility as a scaling factor for calculating quality measurements at different levels of data hierarchy. Examples are used to demonstrate the use of utility-driven assessment in real-world data management scenarios and the broader implications for data management are discussed},

  abstract = {"This is clearly the most comprehensive and thoughtful compendium of knowledge on language/vision integration out there, and I'm sure it will be a valuable resources to many researchers and instructors." - Sven Dickinson, Series Editor (University of Toronto)

Modeling data from visual and linguistic modalities together creates opportunities for better understanding of both, and supports many useful applications. Examples of dual visual-linguistic data includes images with keywords, video with narrative, and figures in documents. We consider two key task-driven themes: translating from one modality to another (e.g., inferring annotations for images) and understanding the data using all modalities, where one modality can help disambiguate information in another. The multiple modalities can either be essentially semantically redundant (e.g., keywords provided by a person looking at the image), or largely complementary (e.g., meta data such as the camera used). Redundancy and complementarity are two endpoints of a scale, and we observe that good performance on translation requires some redundancy, and that joint inference is most useful where some information is complementary.

Computational methods discussed are broadly organized into ones for simple keywords, ones going beyond keywords toward natural language, and ones considering sequential aspects of natural language. Methods for keywords are further organized based on localization of semantics, going from words about the scene taken as whole, to words that apply to specific parts of the scene, to relationships between parts. Methods going beyond keywords are organized by the linguistic roles that are learned, exploited, or generated. These include proper nouns, adjectives, spatial and comparative prepositions, and verbs. More recent developments in dealing with sequential structure include automated captioning of scenes and video, alignment of video and text, and automated answering of questions about scenes depicted in images.

This necessitates dynamically integrating different databases into a single repository or a warehouse. The data integrated in these warehouses are extracted from various heterogeneous sources, having different degrees of quality and trust. Most of the time, they are neither rigorously chosen nor carefully controlled for data quality. Data preparation and data quality metadata are recommended but still insufficiently exploited for ensuring quality and validating the results of information retrieval or data mining techniques. In a previous work, we built a data warehouse called GEDAW (Gene Expression Data Warehouse) that stores various information: data on genes expressed in the liver during iron overload and liver diseases, relevant information from public databanks (mostly in XML), DNA-chips home experiments and also medical records. Based on our past experience, this paper reports briefly on the lessons learned from biomedical data integration and data quality issues, and the solutions we propose to the numerous problems of schema evolution of both data sources and warehousing system. In this context, we present QDex, a Quality driven bio-Data Exploration tool, which provides a functional and modular architecture for database profiling and exploration, enabling users to set up query workflows and take advantage of data quality profiling metadata before the complex processes of data integration in the warehouse. An illustration with QDex Tool is shown afterwards.},

After motivating the idea of integral, we devote a full chapter to the Riemann integral and the next to the Lebesgue integral. Another chapter compares and contrasts the two theories. The concluding chapter offers brief introductions to the Henstock integral, the Daniell integral, the Stieltjes integral, and other commonly used integrals. The purpose of this book is to provide a quick but accurate (and detailed) introduction to all aspects of modern integration theory.

@article{monge2000matching,
  abstract = {Detecting database records that are approximate duplicates, but not exact duplicates, is an important task. Databases may contain duplicate records concerning the same real-world entity because of data entry errors, unstandardized abbreviations, or differences in the detailed schemas of records from multi- ple databases - such as what happens in data warehousing where records from multiple data sources are integrated into a single source of information - among other reasons. In this paper we review a system to detect approximate duplicate records in a database and provide properties that a pair-wise record matching algorithm must have in order to have a successful duplicate detection system. Many of the current technological improvements has lead to an explosion in the growth of data available in digital form. The most significant of these being the popularity of the Internet and specifically the world wide web. There are other more traditional sources of data however that has also contributed to this exponential growth. The commercial success of relational databases in the early 1980's has lead to the efficient storage and retrieval of data. Hardware improvements have also contributed significantly now that external storage has faster access times and continue to increase in density. Such technological changes allow for easy and widespread distribution and publishing of data. The availability of these data sources increases not only the amount of data, but also the variety of and quality in which such data appears. These factors create a number of problems. The work presented here concentrates on one such problem: the detection of multiple representations of a single entity.},

To make things more complicated, the judgment of what is "good" data will often depend on the task at hand or the subjective requirements of data owners or data consumers. Some data quality requirements can be modeled using data quality rules, i.e. executable definitions that allow the identification and measurement of data quality problems. In this paper, we provide a conceptual model that allows the representation of such rules and other quality-related knowledge using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Based on our model, it is possible to monitor and assess the quality of data sources and to automate data cleansing tasks. The use of a generic conceptual model based on Semantic Web formalisms supports the definition of reusable, broadly applicable SPARQL queries and portable applications for data quality management (DQM). Furthermore, the explicit representation of rules in RDF/OWL facilitates rule management tasks, e.g. for analyzing consistency among the rules, and allows to collaborate and create a shared understanding.},

This paper proposes systematizing approaches to the engineering of OD-based systems. To prioritize and structure research areas we consider historic developments, such as big data hype; synthesize defining features of OD, such as confounded measures and unobserved context; and discuss emerging new applications, such as diverse and large OD collections and extremely short development intervals.

In particular, the paper examines the nature of the relationship between Data Quality and several research coordinates that are relevant in Big Data, such as the variety of data types, data sources and application domains, focusing on maps, semi-structured texts, linked open data, sensor & sensor networks and official statistics. Consequently a set of structural characteristics is identified and a systematization of the a posteriori correlation between them and quality dimensions is provided. Finally, Big Data quality issues are considered in a conceptual framework suitable to map the evolution of the quality paradigm according to three core coordinates that are significant in the context of the Big Data phenomenon: the data type considered, the source of data, and the application domain. Thus, the framework allows ascertaining the relevant changes in data quality emerging with the Big Data phenomenon, through an integrative and theoretical literature review.},

While MODS is not currently a Big Data initiative, potential future Big Data requirements under consideration (in the areas of geospatial data, document and records data, and textual data) could easily move MODS into the realm of Big Data. Each of these areas has its own data quality issues that must be considered. By better understanding the data quality issues in these Big Data areas of growth, we hope to explore specific differences in the nature and type of Big Data quality problems from what is typically experienced in traditionally sized data sets. This understanding should facilitate the acquisition of the MODS data warehouse though improvements in the requirements and downstream design efforts. It should also enable the crafting of better strategies and tools for profiling, measurement, assessment, and action processing of Big Data Quality problems.},

  abstract = {As we enter the 21st century, we are at the dawn of the Information Age. Data and information are now as vital to an organization‚Äôs well being and future success as oxygen is to humans. And without a fresh supply of clean, unpolluted data, companies will struggle to survive. The Data Warehousing Institute estimates that data quality problems cost U.S. businesses more than $600 billion a year. Yet, most executives are oblivious to the data quality lacerations that are slowly bleeding their companies to death. More injurious than the unnecessary printing, postage, and staffing costs is the slow but steady erosion of an organization‚Äôs credibility among customers and suppliers, as well as its inability to make sound decisions based on accurate information. The problem with data is that its quality quickly degenerates over time. Experts say 2 percent of records in a customer file become obsolete in one month because customers die, divorce, marry, and move. In addition, data entry errors, systems migrations, and changes to source systems, among other things, generate bucket loads of errors. More perniciously, as organizations fragment into different divisions and units, interpretations of data elements mutate to meet the local business needs. A data element that one individual finds valuable may be nonsense to an individual in a different group. Fortunately, new strategic initiatives, such as CRM, business intelligence, and supply chain management are sounding a wake-up call to top executives. Many are learning the hard way that data quality problems can sabotage the best laid strategies and expose errors to a much broader, and critical, external audience. The Goal Is Achievable. The good news is that achieving high quality data is not beyond the means of any company. The keys are to treat data as a strategic corporate resource; develop a program for managing data quality with a commitment from the top; and hire, train, or outsource experienced data quality professionals to oversee and carry out the program. Then, it is critical for organizations to sustain a commitment to managing data quality over time and adjust monitoring and cleansing processes to changes in the business and underlying systems. Commercial data quality tools and service bureaus automate the process of auditing, cleaning, and monitoring data quality. They can play a significant role in data quality efforts and be well worth the investment. Most commercial tools are now moving beyond auditing and scrubbing name and address data to tackle other data types. They are also beginning to step up to the challenge of validating company-specific business rules, and augmenting addresses with geospatial and demographic data, among other things. Data is a vital resource. Companies that invest proportionally to manage this resource will stand a stronger chance of succeeding in today‚Äôs competitive global economy than those that squander this critical resource by neglecting to ensure adequate levels of quality},

A challenging issue in this application area is the restricted quality of sensor data due to limited sensor precision and sensor failures. Moreover, data stream processing to meet resource constraints in streaming environments introduces additional noise and decreases the data quality. In order to avoid wrong business decisions due to dirty data, quality characteristics have to be captured, processed, and provided to the respective business task. However, the issue of how to efficiently provide applications with information about data quality is still an open research problem. In this article, we address this problem by presenting a flexible model for the propagation and processing of data quality. The comprehensive analysis of common data stream processing operators and their impact on data quality allows a fruitful data evaluation and diminishes incorrect business decisions. Further, we propose the data quality model control to adapt the data quality granularity to the data stream interestingness.},

Based on research in various domains including applied statistics, health informatics, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, database management, and digital libraries, significant advances have been achieved over the last decade in all aspects of the data matching process, especially on how to improve the accuracy of data matching, and its scalability to large databases.

Peter Christen's book is divided into three parts: Part I, ``Overview'', introduces the subject by presenting several sample applications and their special challenges, as well as a general overview of a generic data matching process. Part II, ``Steps of the Data Matching Process'', then details its main steps like pre-processing, indexing, field and record comparison, classification, and quality evaluation. Lastly, part III, ``Further Topics'', deals with specific aspects like privacy, real-time matching, or matching unstructured data. Finally, it briefly describes the main features of many research and open source systems available today.

By providing the reader with a broad range of data matching concepts and techniques and touching on all aspects of the data matching process, this book helps researchers as well as students specializing in data quality or data matching aspects to familiarize themselves with recent research advances and to identify open research challenges in the area of data matching. To this end, each chapter of the book includes a final section that provides pointers to further background and research material. Practitioners will better understand the current state of the art in data matching as well as the internal workings and limitations of current systems. Especially, they will learn that it is often not feasible to simply implement an existing off-the-shelf data matching system without substantial adaption and customization. Such practical considerations are discussed for each of the major steps in the data matching process.},

How can you apply analytics to reveal key business insights? What can you learn about your customers and products? How soon can you get started?

But wait. There are things you need to do first ‚Äì reliable data management practices you need to put in place before fully taking advantage of big data. This paper explains why data quality and data governance are so important to large-scale analytics. It will help you learn how to balance governance with usability so you can come up with a strategic plan for managing big data, and it includes a checklist of things to look for when evaluating data management tools for big data.},

@inproceedings{wang2014sampleandclean,
  abstract = {In emerging Big Data scenarios, obtaining timely, high-quality answers to aggregate queries is difficult due to the challenges of processing and cleaning large, dirty data sets. To increase the speed of query processing, there has been a resurgence of interest in sampling-based approximate query processing (SAQP). In its usual formulation, however, SAQP does not address data cleaning at all, and in fact, exacerbates answer quality problems by introducing sampling error. In this paper, we explore an intriguing opportunity. That is, we explore the use of sampling to actually improve answer quality. We introduce the Sample-and-Clean framework, which applies data cleaning to a relatively small subset of the data and uses the results of the cleaning process to lessen the impact of dirty data on aggregate query answers. We derive confidence intervals as a function of sample size and show how our approach addresses error bias. We evaluate the Sample-and-Clean framework using data from three sources: the TPC-H benchmark with synthetic noise, a subset of the Microsoft academic citation index and a sensor data set. Our results are consistent with the theoretical confidence intervals and suggest that the Sample-and-Clean framework can produce significant improvements in accuracy compared to query processing without data cleaning and speed compared to data cleaning without sampling.},

The objective of this study is to identify the most important factors for accounting information quality and their impact on AIS data quality outcomes. The article includes an extensive literature review and summarizes studies in quality management, data quality, accounting information systems, and enterprise planning in helping to identify a set of critical success factors for data quality. The study uses empirical data to answer the research question and test the research hypothesis. Study results show that the top three most important factors that affect accounting information systems‚Äô data quality are top management commitment, the nature of the accounting information systems (such as the suitability of the systems), and input controls. The article further uses regression analysis to test the effect of those factors on AIS data quality, finding that there is a significant positive relationship between the perceived performance of the three most important factors and perceived AIS data quality outcomes.},

However, just because you have data doesn't mean you can use it effectively. If not properly integrated, data can actually encourage false conclusions that result in bad decisions and lost opportunities. Entity Resolution (ER) is a powerful tool for transforming data into accurate, value-added information. Using entity resolution methods and techniques, you can identify equivalent records from multiple sources corresponding to the same real-world person, place, or thing. This emerging area of data management is clearly explained throughout the book. It teaches you the process of locating and linking information about the same entity - eliminating duplications - and making crucial business decisions based on the results. This book is an authoritative, vendor-independent technical reference for researchers, graduate students and practitioners, including architects, technical analysts, and solution developers. In short, Entity Resolution and Information Quality gives you the applied level know-how you need to aggregate data from disparate sources and form accurate customer and product profiles that support effective marketing and sales. It is an invaluable guide for succeeding in today's info-centric environment. First authoritative reference explaining entity resolution and how to use it effectively Provides practical system design advice to help you get a competitive advantage Includes a companion site with synthetic customer data for applicatory exercises, and access to a Java-based Entity Resolution program.},

@inproceedings{kontokostas2014testdriven,
  abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) comprises an unprecedented volume of structured data on the Web. However, these datasets are of varying quality ranging from extensively curated datasets to crowdsourced or extracted data of often relatively low quality. We present a methodology for test-driven quality assessment of Linked Data, which is inspired by test-driven software development. We argue that vocabularies, ontologies and knowledge bases should be accompanied by a number of test cases, which help to ensure a basic level of quality. We present a methodology for assessing the quality of linked data resources, based on a formalization of bad smells and data quality problems. Our formalization employs SPARQL query templates, which are instantiated into concrete quality test case queries. Based on an extensive survey, we compile a comprehensive library of data quality test case patterns. We perform automatic test case instantiation based on schema constraints or semi-automatically enriched schemata and allow the user to generate specific test case instantiations that are applicable to a schema or dataset. We provide an extensive evaluation of five LOD datasets, manual test case instantiation for five schemas and automatic test case instantiations for all available schemata registered with Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV). One of the main advantages of our approach is that domain specific semantics can be encoded in the data quality test cases, thus being able to discover data quality problems beyond conventional quality heuristics.},

  abstract = {The supply chain is a complex set of operations involving many different organizations, suppliers and parts. It includes manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment as well as retailers and consumers of the products. There are many pain points across the supply chain, some of which are specific to the supply chain, while others span across numerous or all industries. Some of these pain points can be related to incorrect or incomplete data used by the business processes. Enterprise information touches so many aspects of the supply chain it becomes imperative that the information used in your business processes and day-to-day operations is of the highest quality possible. The cornerstone of an efficient supply chain begins with complete and accurate product, customer and reference data. The best way to get high-quality data for your supply chain is by implementing a Master Data Management (MDM) platform. An MDM solution can help your business:

‚Ä¢ Ensure proper storage in the warehouse
‚Ä¢ Lower transportation costs and emissions
‚Ä¢ Reduce last-minute, expensive shipping due to incorrect product information
‚Ä¢ Reduce product ``road miles,'' potential spoilage and returns to the warehouse from deliveries that don‚Äôt match orders
‚Ä¢ Reduce exceptions
‚Ä¢ Facilitate the order-to-cash process
‚Ä¢ Ensure customer satisfaction and avoid customer retention issues or negative publicity surrounding the product, brand or company

MDM's function is to aggregate product, reference, customer and potentially other data from disparate systems. It also performs data-quality processes to merge records and remove duplications, validate the data against business rules and then approve the data through workflows. Trusted data then is available for applications, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) services, business processes, and data warehouse and business intelligence systems. Read this white paper for more details on how a MDM strategy and solution can help you resolve many of the pain points in your supply chain and improve business performance as well.},

@article{simon2008introduction,
  abstract = {The text is designed for use in a forty-lecture introductory course covering linear algebra, multivariable differential calculus, and an introduction to real analysis.

The core material of the book is arranged to allow for the main introductory material on linear algebra, including basic vector space theory in Euclidean space and the initial theory of matrices and linear systems, to be covered in the first ten or eleven lectures, followed by a similar number of lectures on basic multivariable analysis, including first theorems on differentiable functions on domains in Euclidean space and a brief introduction to submanifolds. The book then concludes with further essential linear algebra, including the theory of determinants, eigenvalues, and the spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices, and further multivariable analysis, including the contraction mapping principle and the inverse and implicit function theorems. There is also an appendix which provides a nine-lecture introduction to real analysis. There are various ways in which the additional material in the appendix could be integrated into a course--for example in the Stanford Mathematics honors program, run as a four-lecture per week program in the Autumn Quarter each year, the first six lectures of the nine-lecture appendix are presented at the rate of one lecture per week in weeks two through seven of the quarter, with the remaining three lectures per week during those weeks being devoted to the main chapters of the text.

It is hoped that the text would be suitable for a quarter or semester course for students who have scored well in the BC Calculus advanced placement examination (or equivalent), particularly those who are considering a possible major in mathematics.

The author has attempted to make the presentation rigorous and complete, with the clarity and simplicity needed to make it accessible to an appropriately large group of students.

  abstract = {In order to enable proper system and integration testing, it is often necessary to have huge test data inventories, reflecting the heterogeneous live system. Although the maintenance of large data stores can be guided by advice obtained from data quality evaluations, this technique can be only partly applied to test data inventories. Assessing test data quality is difficult, as the well-known data quality dimensions are not applicable in an easy fashion. For example, an otherwise good value of 100% for correctness would not allow to store erroneous test data items. The need for data quality dimensions dedicated to assessing test data quality can't be satisfied by well-known data quality dimensions. In this paper, we present our thesis approach to identify and validate new quality dimensions applicable for test data quality and develop quantification methods. We propose proximity to reality and degree of coverage as two new test data quality dimension and sketch quantification approach to measures, specifically suited for test data.},

@misc{yu2010exploratory,
  abstract = {Today there are quite a few widespread misconceptions of exploratory data analysis (EDA). One of these misperceptions is that EDA is said to be opposed to statistical modeling. Actually, the essence of EDA is not about putting aside all modeling and preconceptions; rather, researchers are urged not to start the analysis with a strong preconception only, and thus modeling is still legitimate in EDA. In addition, the nature of EDA has been changing due to the emergence of new methods and convergence between EDA and other methodologies, such as data mining and resampling. Therefore, conventional conceptual frameworks of EDA might no longer be capable of coping with this trend. In this article, EDA is introduced in the context of data mining and resampling with an emphasis on three goals: cluster detection, variable selection, and pattern recognition. TwoStep clustering, classification trees, and neural networks, which are powerful techniques to accomplish the preceding goals, respectively, are illustrated with concrete examples.},

@book{urdan2010statistics,
  abstract = {This introductory textbook provides an inexpensive, brief overview of statistics to help readers gain a better understanding of how statistics work and how to interpret them correctly. Each chapter describes a different statistical technique, ranging from basic concepts like central tendency and describing distributions to more advanced concepts such as t tests, regression, repeated measures ANOVA, and factor analysis. Each chapter begins with a short description of the statistic and when it should be used. This is followed by a more in-depth explanation of how the statistic works. Finally, each chapter ends with an example of the statistic in use, and a sample of how the results of analyses using the statistic might be written up for publication. A glossary of statistical terms and symbols is also included. Using the author‚Äôs own data and examples from published research and the popular media, the book is a straightforward and accessible guide to statistics.

New features in the fourth edition include:

sets of work problems in each chapter with detailed solutions and additional problems online to help students test their understanding of the material,
new "Worked Examples" to walk students through how to calculate and interpret the statistics featured in each chapter,
new examples from the author‚Äôs own data and from published research and the popular media to help students see how statistics are applied and written about in professional publications,
many more examples, tables, and charts to help students visualize key concepts, clarify concepts, and demonstrate how the statistics are used in the real world.
a more logical flow, with correlation directly preceding regression, and a combined glossary appearing at the end of the book,

  abstract = {Social Master Data Management (Social MDM) is the new revolution in business data processing that marries customer and product centricity with big data to radically improve customer experiences and product strategy. Traditional master data management (MDM)‚Äîthe set of processes, practices, and technologies for creating a single view of common core business objects shared across multiple business processes and multiple systems (such as customer, product, vendor, and location )‚Äîis widely used by enterprises to improve the marketing, operational, and support processes for their customers. However, the focus of traditional MDM is structured data‚Äîand today, valuable information about customers and products is locked inside of vast amounts of unstructured, transactional, and social data such as tweets, blogs, Facebook, email, call center transcripts, call data records, and so on. There has been an explosion in technology like Hadoop and BigInsights to extract that information, but often those efforts have limited reach because they are not tied into the existing insight about customers and products contained in MDM systems.

In Beyond Big Data: Using Social MDM to Drive Deep Customer Insight , we explain how the union of social, mobile, location, and master data:

‚Ä¢ Creates a richer relationship with existing customers
‚Ä¢ Improves how you find and target new customers with the right products
‚Ä¢ Delivers deeper understanding of how your customers think and feel about your products
‚Ä¢ Brings the immediacy of mobile technology to create new ways to engage with customers},

  abstract = {This second edition of Syntactic Theory: A Formal Introduction expands and improves upon a truly unique introductory syntax textbook. Like the first edition, its focus is on the development of precisely formulated grammars whose empirical predictions can be directly tested. There is also considerable emphasis on the prediction and evaluation of grammatical hypotheses, as well as on integrating syntactic hypotheses with matters of semantic analysis.

The book covers the core areas of English syntax from the last quarter century, including complementation, control, "raising constructions," passives, the auxiliary system, and the analysis of long distance dependency constructions. Syntactic Theory's step-by-step introduction to a consistent grammar in these core areas is complemented by extensive problem sets drawing from a variety of languages.

The book's theoretical perspective is presented in the context of current models of language processing, and the practical value of the constraint-based, lexicalist grammatical architecture proposed has already been demonstrated in computer language processing applications. This thoroughly reworked second edition includes revised and extended problem sets, updated analyses, additional examples, and more detailed exposition throughout.},

  abstract = {This comprehensive handbook, written by leading experts in the field, details the groundbreaking research conducted under the breakthrough GALE program--The Global Autonomous Language Exploitation within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), while placing it in the context of previous research in the fields of natural language and signal processing, artificial intelligence and machine translation. The most fundamental contrast between GALE and its predecessor programs was its holistic integration of previously separate or sequential processes. In earlier language research programs, each of the individual processes was performed separately and sequentially: speech recognition, language recognition, transcription, translation, and content summarization. The GALE program employed a distinctly new approach by executing these processes simultaneously. Speech and language recognition algorithms now aid translation and transcription processes and vice versa. This combination of previously distinct processes has produced significant research and performance breakthroughs and has fundamentally changed the natural language processing and machine translation fields. This comprehensive handbook provides an exhaustive exploration into these latest technologies in natural language, speech and signal processing, and machine translation, providing researchers, practitioners and students with an authoritative reference on the topic.},

  abstract = {With the proliferation of huge amounts of (heterogeneous) data on the Web, the importance of information retrieval (IR) has grown considerably over the last few years. Big players in the computer industry, such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!, are the primary contributors of technology for fast access to Web-based information; and searching capabilities are now integrated into most information systems, ranging from business management software and customer relationship systems to social networks and mobile phone applications. Ceri and his co-authors aim at taking their readers from the foundations of modern information retrieval to the most advanced challenges of Web IR. To this end, their book is divided into three parts. The first part addresses the principles of IR and provides a systematic and compact description of basic information retrieval techniques (including binary, vector space and probabilistic models as well as natural language search processing) before focusing on its application to the Web. Part two addresses the foundational aspects of Web IR by discussing the general architecture of search engines (with a focus on the crawling and indexing processes), describing link analysis methods (specifically Page Rank and HITS), addressing recommendation and diversification, and finally presenting advertising in search (the main source of revenues for search engines). The third and final part describes advanced aspects of Web search, each chapter providing a self-contained, up-to-date survey on current Web research directions. Topics in this part include meta-search and multi-domain search, semantic search, search in the context of multimedia data, and crowd search.},

These tools and attitudes complement the use of significance and hypothesis tests used in confirmatory data analysis (CDA). Although EDA complements rather than replaces CDA, use of CDA without EDA is seldom warranted. Even when well-specified theories are held, EDA helps one interpret the results of CDA and may reveal unexpected or misleading patterns in the data. This article introduces the central heuristics and computational tools of EDA and contrasts it with CDA and exploratory statistics in general. EDA techniques are illustrated using previously published psychological data. Changes in statistical training and practice are recommended to incorporate these tools.},

Therefore, we visualize traffic data together with digital maps and support analytical queries through this interactive visual interface. As a case study, we demonstrate VAST on real-world taxi GPS and meter data sets from 15, 000 taxis running two months in a Chinese city of over 10 million population.

  abstract = {The problem of exchanging data between different databases with different schemas is an area of immense importance. Consequently data exchange has been one of the most active research topics in databases over the past decade. Foundational questions related to data exchange largely revolve around three key problems: how to build target solutions; how to answer queries over target solutions; and how to manipulate schema mappings themselves?

@book{salsburg2001tasting,
  abstract = {An insightful, revealing history of the magical mathematics that transformed our world.

    At a summer tea party in Cambridge, England, a guest states that tea poured into milk tastes different from milk poured into tea. Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of the group. But one man, Ronald Fisher, proposes to scientifically test the hypothesis. There is no better person to conduct such an experiment, for Fisher is a pioneer in the field of statistics.

    The Lady Tasting Tea spotlights not only Fisher's theories but also the revolutionary ideas of dozens of men and women which affect our modern everyday lives. Writing with verve and wit, David Salsburg traces breakthroughs ranging from the rise and fall of Karl Pearson's theories to the methods of quality control that rebuilt postwar Japan's economy, including a pivotal early study on the capacity of a small beer cask at the Guinness brewing factory. Brimming with intriguing tidbits and colorful characters, The Lady Tasting Tea salutes the spirit of those who dared to look at the world in a new way.

    The seemingly unlikely title refers to an actual gathering on a summer afternoon in Cambridge, England in the late 1920s. One of the women in the group insisted that tea tastes different depending on whether it is poured into milk or if the milk is poured into the tea. How might one test whether this proposition is true? It turns out that there were some mathematical luminaries present at that tea party, and what unfolded as a result of their thoughts about this problem of testing is what we now call statistics.

    The use of statistics today is ubiquitous. It starts in the morning with the weather report that forecasts the chances of rain for the day, and goes on to political polling, or the results of pharmaceutical research regarding some health issue, or economic probabilities that this or that might happen. We are bombarded with statistics, and in many cases use them, well or poorly, to inform decision making. In general, even if we never studied the subject in school, we think we have some feeling for what they mean. After reading Salsburg's book I now have a clearer understanding of how mathematical probabilities are related to the real world and to specific individuals. He does not include any statistical formulas, but rather describes how this way of thinking has replaced the world of phenomena, and his clear thinking is well worth the read.

    Salsburg describes mathematician Ronald A. Fisher starting to work with statistics early on, collecting data on the increasing weight of his newborn son. This added an element of time to the data that made the seemingly independent data of real life relational. He went on to develop parameters to deal with this that were oversimplified to the point of being untrue. In an exciting chapter on Andrei Kolmogorov's contributions to dealing with this element, ``time,"" Salsburg suggests that if Kolmogorov had not died prematurely, his work would have revolutionized science as we know it.

    The book is full of real-life examples of questions that concern us, and shows how individual personalities, described in careful chronological order, added their contributions to the general understanding of concrete questions. Salsburg has a gift for characterizing the personalities and their quirks, and tells a fast-moving, humorous tale of the human quest to quantify uncertainty. There is a fascinating thread woven through the book concerning the limitations and inadequacies, both practical and philosophical, of looking at the world statistically. This thread is mixed with true admiration and appreciation for the genuine value of the many contributions that were made to this way of looking at the world. At the end of the book, Salsburg hints that there is a need for ``geniuses" of a new kind, similar to Kolmogorov, who, in the near future, might start a whole new paradigm.

    This is the fun side of statistics. David Salsburg's popular account of some of the great statisticians is a great read, full of anecdotes and unusual personal information. It starts around the turn of the last century with Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, W. S. Gossett ('Student' of the t-test) and, of course, R. A. Fisher, and continues with Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman and Florence Nightingale David.

    Thus far, the action is all at University College London and Cambridge, but the book then spreads out worldwide. There are accounts of the life and work of many twentieth-century statisticians, from A. N. Kolmogorov's work on the axioms of probability, through I. J. Good's work on cryptography at Bletchley Park and subsequently on bayesian methods, to the many achievements of John Tukey, not least the fast Fourier transform. Along the way there are descriptions of the great (and still unresolved) wrangles between statisticians about inverse probability and the foundations of inductive inference.

    The title of the book refers to a famous chapter in Fisher's The Design of Experiments (1935). In this chapter Fisher illustrates the principles of experimental design by discussing the hypothetical problem of how to test the claim that it is possible to tell whether the tea is put into the cup before or after the milk. The first riveting fact I discovered from this book is that the problem is not entirely hypothetical. It is based on an actual incident at a tea party in Cambridge in the late 1920s (the author knows someone who was there).

    The book is crammed with such personal anecdotes, both amusing and sometimes (thanks to Hitler and Stalin) harrowing. For example, I discovered that I.J. Good, who worked for much of his life in the United States, is the son of a Polish immigrant to London's East End who owned a well-known antique jewellery shop (Cameo Corner) near the British Museum (I bought a ring there). Salsburg does not, however, mention Florence David's predilection for cigars of churchillian proportions. I have often wondered what impression they must have made when she eventually moved to California; these days she would probably be arrested.

    Salsburg's account is entirely non-mathematical, and he makes a creditable attempt at verbal descriptions of some of the great work. Nevertheless, the difficulty of conveying the ideas in words was brought home to me by the modest amount that I felt I understood in those areas I did not know about already, such as martingales (I trust his mathematical definition is more accurate than his nautical definition of this word).

    When it comes to the science in the book -- as opposed to history and anecdote -- Salsburg's views will not gain universal agreement. One of his recurring themes is that the old, deterministic clockwork Universe was swept aside by the ``statistical revolution ... The `things' of science are not the observables but the mathematical distribution functions that describe the probabilities associated with observations."

    My problem here is that Salsburg makes little distinction between the unavoidable variability that results from the random behavior of atoms, and avoidable variability due to errors of observation. At the level of individual molecules, atoms and subatomic particles, random behavior is part of the physics of the system. In subatomic physics and in my own field of single-ion channels, it is quite true that what we observe are distributions. But nevertheless we can, and do, regard the (true) means of such distributions as deterministic constants. We can measure the duration of random lifetimes with high accuracy relative to the real variability of the system.

    But these are specialist areas of research. In most areas, the variability is seldom of this unavoidable single-molecule sort. Most people would think it entirely reasonable that when you measure, for example, the equilibrium constant for a well-defined reaction, there is a true value. Of course there will be experimental errors in measuring this value, but the problem is essentially deterministic.

    Crucial though statistical ideas are in many areas, I cannot help thinking that Salsburg exaggerates when he talks of statistics as ``probably the single most important tool of biological science". What about the genome, the electron microscope and the patch clamp? If you read the great papers in my own area, for example those of Hodgkin and Huxley, of Bernard Katz, or of Neher and Sakmann, you will find very little statistics (at least of the sort that refers to measurement errors), and there was no need for any. In other areas, such as clinical trials and psychology, the use of statistics is critically important. However, one is reminded of the dangers of excessive enthusiasm for numbers when the author unblushingly tells us that ``psychology developed techniques of measuring intelligence".

    Most practical scientists who are dealing with large numbers of molecules that behave in an essentially deterministic way remain largely untouched by the ``statistical revolution". The lady tasting tea is famous among statisticians, but none of my colleagues recognized the allusion, and very few are interested in the basis of scientific inference. This may show a lack of intellectual curiosity -- or may merely reflect the amount of time they have to spend on bureaucratic activities imposed by governments and universities -- but most of the time it does not hinder their science very much. It would be nice to think that the book would be read by many biologists, and indeed by the general public, but I suspect the main audience will be statisticians -- amateur and professional.

    Fisher's lady tasting tea was intended to illustrate the crucial importance of randomization in experimental design. This lesson has been learned well in areas such as the design of clinical trials, but is still largely ignored in laboratory sciences. Perhaps Salsburg does have a point. Studies on transgenic animals are a mainstay of research in the post-genomic era, and they can give useful results. But it is impossible to randomize gene-knockout experiments. And nobody seems to worry that this makes it impossible to do a valid significance test on the results of their experiments. Perhaps molecular biologists should read about Fisher's lady.},

This book covers the next step in your growth. OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing), Data Warehousing and Analytics involve seeing data in the aggregate and over time, not as single transactions. Once more it is time to unlearn what you were previously taught. This book is not an in-depth look at particular subjects, but an overview of many subjects that will give the working RDBMS programmers a map of the terra incognita they will faceif they want to grow. * Expert advice from a noted SQL authority and award-winning columnist, who has given ten years of service to the ANSI SQL standards committee and many more years of dependable help to readers of online forums. * First book that teaches what SQL programmers need in order to successfully make the transition from transactional systems (OLTP) into the world of data warehouse data and OLAP. * Offers real-world insights and lots of practical examples. * Covers the OLAP extensions in SQL-99; ETL tools, OLAP features supported in DBMSs, other query tools, simple reports, and statistical software.},

You'll learn how various text corpora are organized, as well as how to create your own custom corpus. Then, you'll move onto text classification with a focus on sentiment analysis. And because NLP can be computationally expensive on large bodies of text, you'll try a few methods for distributed text processing. Finally, you'll be introduced to a number of other small but complementary Python libraries for text analysis, cleaning, and parsing.},

WCI provides an information retrieval framework that is designed to facilitate search and exploration of text documents, and is particularly effective on sparse data sets. Its methodology consists of first defining a dictionary of concepts which are interconnected in a concept graph and then modeling a document by predicting its relevance to any given concept in the concept graph using the concepts that are directly mentioned in the document itself. This technique in effect increases the document recall for any given query, even for very sparse data sets, exposing the user to a variety of connections between their query and a data set of interest.},

The presentation is clear and simple, with core material being described early in the book, and further technicalities introduced only where they are needed by the applications.

Owing to its substantial role in many facets of human life, technology for automatically analyzing and processing natural language has recently become increasingly important. In fact, natural language processing tools have paved the way for entirely new business opportunities. The goal of this book is to facilitate the automatic analysis of natural language in process models and to employ this analysis for assisting process model stakeholders. Therefore, a technique is defined that automatically recognizes and annotates process model element labels. In addition, this technique is leveraged to support organizations in effectively utilizing their process models in various ways. The book is organized into seven chapters. It starts with an overview of business process management and linguistics and continues with conceptual contributions on parsing and annotating process model elements, with the detection and correction of process model guideline violations, with the generation of natural language from process models, and finally ends with the derivation of service candidates from process models.},

Designing a programming language is a metaprogramming activity that bears certain similarities to programming in a regular language, with clarity and simplicity even more important than in ordinary programming. This comprehensive text uses a simple and concise framework to teach key ideas in programming language design and implementation. The book's unique approach is based on a family of syntactically simple pedagogical languages that allow students to explore programming language concepts systematically. It takes as premise and starting point the idea that when language behaviors become incredibly complex, the description of the behaviors must be incredibly simple. The book presents a set of tools (a mathematical metalanguage, abstract syntax, operational and denotational semantics) and uses it to explore a comprehensive set of programming language design dimensions, including dynamic semantics (naming, state, control, data), static semantics (types, type reconstruction, polymporphism, effects), and pragmatics (compilation, garbage collection). The many examples and exercises offer students opportunities to apply the foundational ideas explained in the text.

  abstract = {Graph algorithms are becoming increasingly important for analyzing large datasets in many fields. Real-world graph data follows a pattern of sparsity, that is not uniform but highly skewed towards a few items. Implementing graph traversal, statistics and machine learning algorithms on such data in a scalable manner is quite challenging. As a result, several graph analytics frameworks (GraphLab, CombBLAS, Giraph, SociaLite and Galois among others) have been developed, each offering a solution with different programming models and targeted at different users. Unfortunately, the "Ninja performance gap" between optimized code and most of these frameworks is very large (2-30X for most frameworks and up to 560X for Giraph) for common graph algorithms, and moreover varies widely with algorithms. This makes the end-users' choice of graph framework dependent not only on ease of use but also on performance. In this work, we offer a quantitative roadmap for improving the performance of all these frameworks and bridging the "ninja gap". We first present hand-optimized baselines that get performance close to hardware limits and higher than any published performance figure for these graph algorithms. We characterize the performance of both this native implementation as well as popular graph frameworks on a variety of algorithms. This study helps end-users delineate bottlenecks arising from the algorithms themselves vs. programming model abstractions vs. the framework implementations. Further, by analyzing the system-level behavior of these frameworks, we obtain bottlenecks that are agnostic to specific algorithms. We recommend changes to alleviate these bottlenecks (and implement some of them) and reduce the performance gap with respect to native code. These changes will enable end-users to choose frameworks based mostly on ease of use.},

@book{harrington2010clearly,
  abstract = {Although the core of the SQL language remains relatively unchanged, the most recent release of the SQL standard (SQL:2008) includes two sets of extensions: 1) support for object-relational databases and 2) support for XML. The second edition of this book included some material about the object-relational extensions. However, that set of commands has been greatly extended and the new edition takes that into account. The XML extensions are entirely new to the third edition. A chapter on basic relational concepts will be also added to broaden the audience and make the book more complete in its own right. All of the chapters will be revised to be sure they are up to date. Chapter 10 ("Views, Temporary Tables, and Indexes") from the second edition will be expanded to include common table expression (CTEs). The material in the existing Chapter 14 ("Unimplemented SQL-92 Features 251") will be disbursed through the chapters where the particular type of operation is discussed. While the content throughout will be updated where necessary, the existing organizational structure through chapter 14 will remain largely intact because this coverage represents the stable portion of the SQL language. There will be two NEW chapters at the beginning of the book. Chapter 1 ("The Relational Data Model") covers the relational data model conceptual material; Chapter 2 ("Manipulating Relations with Relational Algebra") covers the relational algebra material that will be pulled from the retrieval chapters. Part 5 ("Non-relational SQL Extensions") will now include the non-relational SQL extensions in three chapters. Chapter 17 (NEW) will cover XML. Chapter 18 will contain the object-relational conceptual material from the original chapter 15 and chapter 19 (NEW) will cover SQL object-relational support. (Some of chapter 19 will come from the second edition, however, a great deal of object-relational support has been added to the current standard and therefore needs to be added.) The other NEW chapter is Chapter 14, which covers triggers and stored procedures. This material was missing from previous editions. Many readers should find it a useful addition. Demonstrates how to formulate SQL queries and how queries are processed to maximize performance of the database management system Explains use of SQL to enter, modify or delete data to maintain database structural elements Covers in great detail new SQL application for XML to meet the growing XML usage in development of online content.},

@book{silver2012signal,
  abstract = {The author has built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair's breadth, and has become a national sensation as a blogger. Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, he examines the world of prediction. Human beings have to make plans and strategize for the future. As the pace of our lives becomes faster and faster, we have to do so more often and more quickly. But are our predictions any good? Is there hope for improvement? In this book the author examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy, ever-increasing data. Many predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. We are wired to detect a signal, and we mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the prediction paradox: the more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, and the more we are willing to learn from our mistakes, the more we can turn information into knowledge and data into foresight. The author examines both successes and failures to determine what more accurate forecasters have in common. In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, he visits innovative forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. Even when their innovations are modest, we can learn from their methods. How can we train ourselves to think probabilistically, as they do? How can the insights of an eighteenth-century Englishman unlock the twenty-first-century challenges of global warming and terrorism? How can being smarter about the future help us make better decisions in the present?},

For many, remembering life without the ability to view the World Wide Web (WWW) through the windows of a browser will be difficult (if not impossible for less 'mature' readers). And is it only seven years since YouTube, a Web site that is ingrained in so many facets of modern life, first came to life? How did we all really survive without FaceBook all those (actually, about 5) years ago? Various estimates put the amount of data stored by consumers and businesses around the world in 2010 in the vicinity of 13 exabytes, with a growth rate of 20--25% per annum. That's a lot of data. No wonder IBM is pursuing building a 120 petabyte storage array . There's obviously going to be a market for such devices in the future. As data volumes of all types, from video and photos to text documents and binary files for science, continue to grow in number and resolution, it's clear we have genuinely entered the realm of data intensive, or big data, computing."--},

The book became a part of Intel's 2012 recommended reading list for developers, and it covers the revolution of mobile computing. The text also highlights the two most important factors in architecture today: parallelism and memory hierarchy. The six chapters that this book is composed of follow a consistent framework: explanation of the ideas in each chapter; a "crosscutting issues" section, which presents how the concepts covered in one chapter connect with those given in other chapters; a "putting it all together" section that links these concepts by discussing how they are applied in real machine; and detailed examples of misunderstandings and architectural traps commonly encountered by developers and architects. The first chapter of the book includes formulas for energy, static and dynamic power, integrated circuit costs, reliability, and availability. Chapter 2 discusses memory hierarchy and includes discussions about virtual machines, SRAM and DRAM technologies, and new material on Flash memory. The third chapter covers the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism in high-performance processors, superscalar execution, dynamic scheduling and multithreading, followed by an introduction to vector architectures in the fourth chapter. Chapters 5 and 6 describe multicore processors and warehouse-scale computers (WSCs), respectively. This book is an important reference for computer architects, programmers, application developers, compiler and system software developers, computer system designers and application developers.

This unique, problem-solving-oriented guide focuses on how to extract the most from GPS animal tracking data, while preventing error propagation and optimizing analysis performance. Based on the open source PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial database, the software platform will allow researchers and managers to integrate and harmonize GPS tracking data together with animal characteristics, environmental data sets, including remote sensing image time series, and other bio-logged data, such as acceleration data. Moreover, the book shows how the powerful R statistical environment can be integrated into the software platform, either connecting the database with R, or embedding the same tools in the database through the PostgreSQL extension Pl/R. The client/server architecture allows users to remotely connect a number of software applications that can be used as a database front end, including GIS software and WebGIS. Each chapter offers a real-world data management and processing problem that is discussed in its biological context; solutions are proposed and exemplified through ad hoc SQL code, progressively exploring the potential of spatial database functions applied to the respective wildlife tracking case. Finally, wildlife tracking management issues are discussed in the increasingly widespread framework of collaborative science and data sharing. GPS animal telemetry data from a real study, freely available online, are used to demonstrate the proposed examples. This book is also suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, if accompanied by the basics of databases.},

Logic programming provides a natural framework for encoding and animating such systems. However, these systems often embody variable binding, a notion that must be treated carefully at a computational level. This book aims to show that a programming language based on a simply typed version of higher-order logic provides an elegant, declarative means for providing such a treatment. Three broad topics are covered in pursuit of this goal. First, a proof-theoretic framework that supports a general view of logic programming is identified. Second, an actual language called [Lambda]Prolog is developed by applying this view to higher-order logic. Finally, a methodology for programming with specifications is exposed by showing how several computations over formal objects such as logical formulas, functional programs, and [lambda]-terms and [pi]-calculus expressions can be encoded in [Lambda]Prolog"--},

@book{dominus2005higherorder,
  abstract = {Most Perl programmers were originally trained as C and Unix programmers, so the Perl programs that they write bear a strong resemblance to C programs. However, Perl incorporates many features that have their roots in other languages such as Lisp. These advanced features are not well understood and are rarely used by most Perl programmers, but they are very powerful. They can automate tasks in everyday programming that are difficult to solve in any other way. One of the most powerful of these techniques is writing functions that manufacture or modify other functions. For example, instead of writing ten similar functions, a programmer can write a general pattern or framework that can then create the functions as needed according to the pattern. For several years Mark Jason Dominus has worked to apply functional programming techniques to Perl. Now Mark brings these flexible programming methods that he has successfully taught in numerous tutorials and training sessions to a wider audience. * Introduces powerful programming methodsnew to most Perl programmersthat were previously the domain of computer scientists* Gradually builds up confidence by describing techniques of progressive sophistication* Shows how to improve everyday programs and includes numerous engaging code examples to illustrate the methods},

By far the most widely used Logic Programming language is Prolog. Prolog is a good choice for developing complex applications, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Logic Programming with Prolog does not assume that the reader is an experienced programmer or has a background in Mathematics, Logic or Artificial Intelligence. It starts from scratch and aims to arrive at the point where quite powerful programs can be written in the language. It is intended both as a textbook for an introductory course and as a self-study book. On completion readers will know enough to use Prolog in their own research or practical projects. Each chapter has self-assessment exercises so that readers may check their own progress. A glossary of the technical terms used completes the book. This second edition has been revised to be fully compatible with SWI-Prolog, a popular multi-platform public domain implementation of the language. Additional chapters have been added covering the use of Prolog to analyse English sentences and to illustrate how Prolog can be used to implement applications of an 'Artificial Intelligence' kind.},

  description = {A groundbreaking, unifying theory of computer science for low-cost, high-quality softwareThe Cognitive Dynamics of Computer Science represents the culmination of more than thirty years of the author's hands-on experience in software development, which has resulted in a remarkable and sensible philosophy and practice of software development. It provides a groundbreaking ontology of computer science, while describing the processes, methodologies, and constructs needed to build high-quality, large-scale computer software systems on schedule and on budget.Based on his own experience in developing successful, low-cost software projects, the author makes a persuasive argument for developers to understand the philosophical underpinnings of software. He asserts that software in reality is an abstraction of the human thought system. The author draws from the seminal works of the great German philosophers--Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer--and recasts their theories of human mind and thought to create a unifying theory of computer science, cognitive dynamics, that opens the door to the next generation of computer science and forms the basic architecture for total autonomy.* Four detailed cases studies effectively demonstrate how philosophy and practice merge to meet the objective of high-quality, low-cost software.* The Autonomous Cognitive System chapter sets forth a model for a completely autonomous computer system, using the human thought system as the model for functional architecture and the human thought process as the model for the functional data process.* Although rooted in philosophy, this book is practical, addressing all the key areas that software professionals need to master in order to remain competitive and minimize costs, such as leadership, management, communication, and organization.This thought-provoking work will change the way students and professionals in computer science and software development conceptualize and perform their work. It provides them with both a philosophy and a set of practical tools to produce high-quality, low-cost software.},

  abstract = {We have known about algorithms for millennia, but we have only been writing computer programs for a few decades. A big difference between the Euclidean or Eratosthenes age and ours is that since the middle of the twentieth century, we express the algorithms we conceive using formal languages: programming languages. Computer scientists are not the only ones who use formal languages. Optometrists, for example, prescribe eyeglasses using very technical expressions, such as OD: -1.25 (-0.50) 180 OS: -1.00 (-0.25) 180, in which the parentheses are essential. Many such formal languages have been created throughout history: musical notation, algebraic notation, etc. In particular, such languages have long been used to control machines, such as looms and cathedral chimes. However, until the appearance of programming languages, those languages were only of limited importance: they were restricted to specialized fields with only a few specialists and written texts of those languages remained relatively scarce. This situation has changed with the appearance of programming languages, which have a wider range of applications than the prescription of eye glasses or the control of a loom,are used by large communities, and have allowed the creation of programs of many hundreds of thousands of lines.},

@book{blake2012semantic,
  abstract = {Over the last decade, a great amount of effort and resources have been invested in the development of Semantic Web Service (SWS) frameworks. Numerous description languages, frameworks, tools, and matchmaking and composition algorithms have been proposed. Nevertheless, when faced with a real-world problem, it is still very hard to decide which of these different approaches to use. In this book, the editors present an overall overview and comparison of the main current evaluation initiatives for SWS. The presentation is divided into four parts, each referring to one of the evaluation initiatives. Part I covers the long-established first two tracks of the Semantic Service Selection (S3) Contest {u2013} the OWL-S matchmaker evaluation and the SAWSDL matchmaker evaluation. Part II introduces the new S3 Jena Geography Dataset (JGD) cross evaluation contest. Part III presents the Semantic Web Service Challenge. Lastly, Part IV reports on the semantic aspects of the Web Service Challenge. The introduction to each part provides an overview of the evaluation initiative and overall results for its latest evaluation workshops. The following chapters in each part, written by the participants, detail their approaches, solutions and lessons learned. This book is aimed at two different types of readers. Researchers on SWS technology receive an overview of existing approaches in SWS with a particular focus on evaluation approaches; potential users of SWS technologies receive a comprehensive summary of the respective strengths and weaknesses of current systems and thus guidance on factors that play a role in evaluation.},

As we have discussed across many chapters and in many case studies, the limitations that existed with the infrastructures to create, manage and deploy Data Warehouses have been largely eliminated with the availability of Big Data technologies and infrastructure platforms, making the goal of the single version of truth a feasible reality. Integrating and extending Big Data into the Data Warehouse, and creating a larger decision support platform will benefit businesses for years to come. This book has touched upon governance and information lifecycle management aspects of Big Data in the larger program, however you can reuse all the current program management techniques that you follow for the Data Warehouse for this program and even implement agile approaches to integrating and managing data in the Data Warehouse. Technologies will continue to evolve in this spectrum and there will be more additions of solutions, which can be integrated if you follow the modular integration approaches to building and managing the Data Warehouse.

@book{colomb2007ontology,
  abstract = {In order for information systems supporting two different organizations to interoperate, there must be an agreement as to what the words mean. There are many such agreements in place, supporting information systems interoperation in many different application areas. Most of these agreements have been created as part of diverse systems development processes, but since the advent of the Semantic Web in the late 1990s, they have been studied as a kind of software artifact in their own right, called an ontology, or description of a shared world. This book brings together developments from philosophy, artificial intelligence and information systems to formulate a collection of functional requirements for ontology development. Once the functional requirements are established, the book looks at several ontology representation languages: RDFS, OWL, Common Logic and Topic Maps, to show how these languages support the functional requirements, what deficiencies there are, and how the languages relate to each other. Besides a collection of running examples used throughout the book, the entire treatment is supported by an extended example of a hypothetical ontology for the Olympic Games presented first as a set of chapter-end exercises and then as a set of solutions which illustrate the various points made in the text in the context of a single coherent development.IOS Press is an international science, technical and medical publisher of high-quality books for academics, scientists, and professionals in all fields.

@book{hofstedt2011multiparadigm,
  abstract = {Programming languages are often classified according to their paradigms, e.g. imperative, functional, logic, constraint-based, object-oriented, or aspect-oriented. A paradigm characterizes the style, concepts, and methods of the language for describing situations and processes and for solving problems, and each paradigm serves best for programming in particular application areas. Real-world problems, however, are often best implemented by a combination of concepts from different paradigms, because they comprise aspects from several realms, and this combination is more comfortably realized using multiparadigm programming languages. This book deals with the theory and practice of multiparadigm constraint programming languages. The author first elaborates on programming paradigms and languages, constraints, and the merging of programming concepts which yields multiparadigm (constraint) programming languages. In the second part the author inspects two concrete approaches on multiparadigm constraint programming {u2013} the concurrent constraint functional language CCFL, which combines the functional and the constraint-based paradigms and allows the description of concurrent processes; and a general framework for multiparadigm constraint programming and its implementation, Meta-S.

  abstract = {Joe Celko's Complete Guide to NoSQL provides a complete overview of non-relational technologies so that you can become more nimble to meet the needs of your organization. As data continues to explode and grow more complex, SQL is becoming less useful for querying data and extracting meaning. In this new world of bigger and faster data, you will need to leverage non-relational technologies to get the most out of the information you have. Learn where, when, and why the benefits of NoSQL outweigh those of SQL with Joe Celko's Complete Guide to NoSQL. This book covers three areas that make today's new data different from the data of the past: velocity, volume and variety. When information is changing faster than you can collect and query it, it simply cannot be treated the same as static data. Celko will help you understand velocity, to equip you with the tools to drink from a fire hose. Old storage and access models do not work for big data. Celko will help you understand volume, as well as different ways to store and access data such as petabytes and exabytes. Not all data can fit into a relational model, including genetic data, semantic data, and data generated by social networks. Celko will help you understand variety, as well as the alternative storage, query, and management frameworks needed by certain kinds of data. Gain a complete understanding of the situations in which SQL has more drawbacks than benefits so that you can better determine when to utilize NoSQL technologies for maximum benefit Recognize the pros and cons of columnar, streaming, and graph databases.},

  abstract = {Data is an expensive and expansive asset. Information capture has forced storage capacity from megabytes to terabytes, exabytes and, pretty soon, zetabytes of data. So the need for accessible storage space for this data is great. To make this huge amount of data usable and relevant, it needs to be organized effectively. Database Base Management Systems, such as Oracle, IBM's DB2, and Microsoft SqlServer are used often, but these are being enhanced continuously and auxiliary tools are being developed every week; there needs to be a fundamental starting point for it all. That stating point is Data Architecture, the blueprint for organizing and structuring of information for services, service providers, and the consumers of that data. Data Architecture: From Zen to Reality explains the principles underlying data architecture, how data evolves with organizations, and the challenges organizations face in structuring and managing their data. It also discusses proven methods and technologies to solve the complex issues dealing with data. The book uses a holistic approach to the field of data architecture by covering the various applied areas of data, including data modelling and data model management, data quality, data governance, enterprise information management, database design, data warehousing, and warehouse design. This book is a core resource for anyone emplacing, customizing or aligning data management systems, taking the Zen-like idea of data architecture to an attainable reality. Presents fundamental concepts of enterprise architecture with definitions and real-world applications and scenarios Teaches data managers and planners about the challenges of building a data architecture roadmap, structuring the right team, and building a long term set of solutions Includes the detail needed to illustrate how the fundamental principles are used in current business practice.},

  abstract = {"Traditional, low-dimensional, small scale data have been successfully dealt with using conventional software engineering and classical statistical methods, such as discriminant analysis, neural networks, genetic algorithms and others. But the change of scale in data collection and the dimensionality of modern data sets has profound implications on the type of analysis that can be done. Recently several kernel-based machine learning algorithms have been developed for dealing with high-dimensional problems, where a large number of features could cause a combinatorial explosion. These methods are quickly gaining popularity, and it is widely believed that they will help to meet the challenge of analysing very large data sets. Learning machines often perform well in a wide range of applications and have nice theoretical properties without requiring any parametric statistical assumption about the source of data (unlike traditional statistical techniques). However, a typical drawback of many machine learning algorithms is that they usually do not provide any useful measure of confidence in the predicted labels of new, unclassifed examples. Confidence estimation is a well-studied area of both parametric and non-parametric statistics; however, usually only low-dimensional problems are considered"--},

Formal analyses of the algorithms and extensive empirical experiments underline that the proposed approach represents an essential step towards the ad-hoc use of text mining in web search and big data analytics. Both web search and big data analytics aim to fulfill peoplesll needs for information in an adhoc manner. The information sought for is often hidden in large amounts of natural language text. Instead of simply returning links to potentially relevant texts, leading search and analytics engines have started to directly mine relevant information from the texts. To this end, they execute text analysis pipelines that may consist of several complex information-extraction and text-classification stages. Due to practical requirements of efficiency and robustness, however, the use of text mining has so far been limited to anticipated information needs that can be fulfilled with rather simple, manually constructed pipelines.},

Big Data Analytics: A Practical Guide for Managers not only supplies descriptions of common tools, but also surveys the various products and vendors that supply the big data market.Comparing and contrasting the different types of analysis commonly conducted with big data, this accessible reference presents clear-cut explanations of the general workings of big data tools. Instead of spending time on HOW to install specific packages, it focuses on the reasons WHY readers would install a given package.The book provides authoritative guidance on a range of tools, including open source and proprietary systems. It details the strengths and weaknesses of incorporating big data analysis into decision-making and explains how to leverage the strengths while mitigating the weaknesses. Describes the benefits of distributed computing in simple terms Includes substantial vendor/tool material, especially for open source decisions Covers prominent software packages, including Hadoop andOracle Endeca Examines GIS and machine learning applications Considers privacy and surveillance issues The book further explores basic statistical concepts that, when misapplied, can be the source of errors. Time and again, big data is treated as an oracle that discovers results nobody would have imagined. While big data can serve this valuable function, all too often these results are incorrect, yet are still reported unquestioningly. The probability of having erroneous results increases as a larger number of variables are compared unless preventative measures are taken.The approach taken by the authors is to explain these concepts so managers can ask better questions of their analysts and vendors as to the appropriateness of the methods used to arrive at a conclusion. Because the world of science and medicine has been grappling with similar issues in the publication of studies, the authors draw on their efforts and apply them to big data.},

@article{vinnik2016analysis,
  abstract = {We present a novel framework for comprehensive exploration of OLAP data by means of user-defined dynamic hierarchical visualizations. The multidimensional data model behind the OLAP architecture is particularly suitable for sophisticated analysis of large data volumes. However, the ultimate benefit of applying OLAP technology depends on the ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù and usability of visual tools available to end-users. The explorative framework of our proposed interface consists of the navigation structure, a selection of hierarchical visualization techniques, and a set of interaction features. The navigation interface allows users to pursue arbitrary disaggregation paths within single data cubes and, more importantly, across multiple cubes. In the course of interaction, the navigation view adapts itself to display the chosen path and the options valid in the current context. Special effort has been invested in handling non-trivial relationships (e.g., mixed granularity) within hierarchical dimensions in a way transparent to the user. We propose a visual structure called Enhanced Decomposition Tree to to be used along with popular ‚Äústate-of-the-art‚Äù hierarchical visualization techniques. Each level of the tree is produced by a disaggregation step, whereas the nodes display the specified subset of measures, either as plain numbers or as an embedded chart. The proposed technique enables a stepwise descent towards the desired level of detail while preserving the history of the interaction. Aesthetic hierarchical layout of the node-link tree ensures clear structural separation between the analyzed values embedded in the nodes and their dimensional characteristics which label the links. Our framework provides an intuitive and powerful interface for exploring complex multidimensional data sets.},

@inproceedings{essa2012student,
  abstract = {We propose a novel design of a Student Success System (S3), a holistic analytical system for identifying and treating at-risk students. S3 synthesizes several strands of risk analytics: the use of predictive models to identify academically at-risk students, the creation of data visualizations for reaching diagnostic insights, and the application of a case-based approach for managing interventions. Such a system poses numerous design, implementation, and research challenges. In this paper we discuss a core research challenge for designing early warning systems such as S3. We then propose our approach for meeting that challenge. A practical implementation of an student risk early warning system, utilizing predictive models, must meet two design criteria: a) the methodology for generating predictive models must be flexible to allow generalization from one context to another; b) the underlying mechanism of prediction should be easily interpretable by practitioners whose end goal is to design meaningful interventions on behalf of students. Our proposed solution applies an ensemble method for predictive modeling using a strategy of decomposition. Decomposition provides a flexible technique for generating and generalizing predictive models across different contexts. Decomposition into interpretable semantic units, when coupled with data visualizations and case management tools, allows practitioners, such as instructors and advisors, to build a bridge between prediction and intervention.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes the visualization cube for modeling interaction in exploratory analysis of spatiotemporal trend information. Recent growth of the Web has brought us various type of information, among which trend information is one of the important information, because it is crucial for our decision making. Although interactive information visualization system is useful for supporting exploratory data analysis of trend information, the design of such systems tends to depend on the idea of each designer. It is expected that establishing adequate interaction model will contribute to the design of those systems. The visualization cube defines the abstract data structure of spatiotemporal trend information, which consists of 4 axes: spatial, temporal, statistics-value, and type-of-views axes. Interactions for generating views for analytic purpose are defined as the operations on it. Based on the interaction model, the prototype system is developed and used in actual classes of an elementary school, of which the result shows the system has enough usability for 5th-grade elementary school students to perform exploratory data analysis. It is expected the visualization cube contributes to the design of interactive information visualization systems.},

  abstract = {The most authoritative and comprehensive guide to dimensional modeling, from its originators‚Äîfully updated

Ralph Kimball introduced the industry to the techniques of dimensional modeling in the first edition of The Data Warehouse Toolkit (1996). Since then, dimensional modeling has become the most widely accepted approach for presenting information in data warehouse and business intelligence (DW/BI) systems. The Data Warehouse Toolkit is recognized as the definitive source for dimensional modeling techniques, patterns, and best practices.

This third edition of the classic reference delivers the most comprehensive library of dimensional modeling techniques ever assembled. Fully updated with fresh insights and best practices, this book provides clear guidelines for designing dimensional models‚Äîand does so in a style that serves the needs of those new to data warehousing as well as experienced professionals.

All the techniques in the book are illustrated with real-world case studies based on the authors' actual DW/BI design experiences. In addition, the Kimball Group's "official" list of dimensional modeling techniques is summarized in a single chapter for easy reference, with pointers from each technique to the case studies where the concepts are brought to life.

The third edition of The Data Warehouse Toolkit covers:

Practical design techniques‚Äîboth basic and advanced‚Äîfor dimension and fact tables
14 case studies, including retail sales, electronic commerce, customer relationship management, procurement, inventory, order management, accounting, human resources, financial services, healthcare, insurance, education, telecommunications, and transportation

Its aim is to present recent results illustrating new trends in intelligent data analysis.It gives a comprehensive overview of current research into the fusion of soft computing methods with probability and statistics.Synergies of both fields might improve intelligent data analysis methods in terms of robustness to noise and applicability to larger datasets, while being able to efficiently obtain understandable solutions of real-world problems.},

It goes beyond the traditional focus on data mining problems to introduce advanced data types such as text, time series, discrete sequences, spatial data, graph data, and social networks. Until now, no single book has addressed all these topics in a comprehensive and integrated way. The chapters of this book fall into one of three categories: Fundamental chapters: Data mining has four main problems, which correspond to clustering, classification, association pattern mining, and outlier analysis. These chapters comprehensively discuss a wide variety of methods for these problems. Domain chapters: These chapters discuss the specific methods used for different domains of data such as text data, time-series data, sequence data, graph data, and spatial data. Application chapters: These chapters study important applications such as stream mining, Web mining, ranking, recommendations, social networks, and privacy preservation. The domain chapters also have an applied flavor. Appropriate for both introductory and advanced data mining courses, Data Mining: The Textbook balances mathematical details and intuition. It contains the necessary mathematical details for professors and researchers, but it is presented in a simple and intuitive style to improve accessibility for students and industrial practitioners (including those with a limited mathematical background). Numerous illustrations, examples, and exercises are included, with an emphasis on semantically interpretable examples.

@inproceedings{bernard2012guided,
  abstract = {Visual cluster analysis provides valuable tools that help analysts to understand large data sets in terms of representative clusters and relationships thereof. Often, the found clusters are to be understood in context of belonging categorical, numerical or textual metadata which are given for the data elements. While often not part of the clustering process, such metadata play an important role and need to be considered during the interactive cluster exploration process. Traditionally, linked-views allow to relate (or loosely speaking: correlate) clusters with metadata or other properties of the underlying cluster data. Manually inspecting the distribution of metadata for each cluster in a linked-view approach is tedious, especially for large data sets, where a large search problem arises. Fully interactive search for potentially useful or interesting cluster to metadata relationships may constitute a cumbersome and long process. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel approach for guiding users in discovering interesting relationships between clusters and associated metadata. Its goal is to guide the analyst through the potentially huge search space. We focus in our work on metadata of categorical type, which can be summarized for a cluster in form of a histogram. We start from a given visual cluster representation, and compute certain measures of interestingness defined on the distribution of metadata categories for the clusters. These measures are used to automatically score and rank the clusters for potential interestingness regarding the distribution of categorical metadata. Identified interesting relationships are highlighted in the visual cluster representation for easy inspection by the user. We present a system implementing an encompassing, yet extensible, set of interestingness scores for categorical metadata, which can also be extended to numerical metadata. Appropriate visual representations are provided for showing the visual correlations, as well as the calculated ranking scores. Focusing on clusters of time series data, we test our approach on a large real-world data set of time-oriented scientific research data, demonstrating how specific interesting views are automatically identified, supporting the analyst discovering interesting and visually understandable relationships.},

AssocExplorer is designed by following the visual information-seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. It effectively uses coloring to deliver information so that users can easily detect things that are interesting to them. If users find a rule interesting, they can explore related rules for further analysis, which allows users to find interesting phenomenon that are difficult to detect when rules are examined separately. Our system also allows users to compare rules and inspect rules with similar item composition but different statistics so that the key factors that contribute to the difference can be isolated.},

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available for download (see below).



C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies.



This book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

Intermediate level, for programmers fairly familiar with Java, but new to the functional style of programming and lambda expressions.Get ready to program in a whole new way. Functional Programming in Java will help you quickly get on top of the new, essential Java 8 language features and the functional style that will change and improve your code. This short, targeted book will help you make the paradigm shift from the old imperative way to a less error-prone, more elegant, and concise coding style that's also a breeze to parallelize. You'll explore the syntax and semantics of lambda expressions, method and constructor references, and functional interfaces. You'll design and write applications better using the new standards in Java 8 and the JDK. Lambda expressions are lightweight, highly concise anonymous methods backed by functional interfaces in Java 8. You can use them to leap forward into a whole new world of programming in Java. With functional programming capabilities, which have been around for decades in other languages, you can now write elegant, concise, less error-prone code using standard Java. This book will guide you though the paradigm change, offer the essential details about the new features, and show you how to transition from your old way of coding to an improved style.In this book you'll see popular design patterns, such as decorator, builder, and strategy, come to life to solve common design problems, but with little ceremony and effort. With these new capabilities in hand, Functional Programming in Java will help you pick up techniques to implement designs that were beyond easy reach in earlier versions of Java. You'll see how you can reap the benefits of tail call optimization, memoization, and effortless parallelization techniques.Java 8 will change the way you write applications. If you're eager to take advantage of the new features in the language, this is the book for you.What you need:Java 8 with support for lambda expressions and the JDK is required to make use of the concepts and the examples in this book.},

Andrew Carstairs-McCarthy explores the implications of these different approaches to words in English. He explains the various ways in which words are related to one another, and shows how the history of the English language has affected word structure. Topics include: words, sentences and dictionaries; a word and its parts (roots and affixes); a word and its forms (inflection); a word and its relatives (derivation); compound words; word structure; productivity; and the historical sources of English word formation.},

Python Data Visualization Cookbook starts by showing how to set up matplotlib and the related libraries that are required for most parts of the book, before moving on to discuss some of the lesser-used diagrams and charts such as Gantt Charts or Sankey diagrams. Initially it uses simple plots and charts to more advanced ones, to make it easy to understand for readers. As the readers will go through the book, they will get to know about the 3D diagrams and animations. Maps are irreplaceable for displaying geo-spatial data, so this book will also show how to build them. In the last chapter, it includes explanation on how to incorporate matplotlib into different environments, such as a writing system, LaTeX, or how to create Gantt charts using Python.},

Outliers arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behavior, fraudulent behavior, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. The original outlier detection methods were arbitrary but now, principled and systematic techniques are used, drawn from the full gamut of Computer Science and Statistics. In this paper, we introduce a survey of contemporary techniques for outlier detection.

Unlike existing work in text analysis, which focuses either on developing sophisticated text analytic techniques or inventing novel visualization metaphors, ours is tightly integrating state-of-the-art text analytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. In this paper, we focus on describing our work from two aspects. First, we present the design and development of a time-based, visual text summary that effectively conveys complex text summarization results produced by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Second, we describe a set of rich interaction tools that allow users to work with a created visual text summary to further interpret the summarization results in context and examine the text collection from multiple perspectives. As a result, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide an effective visual metaphor that transforms complex and even imperfect text summarization results into a comprehensible visual summary of texts. Second, we offer users a set of flexible visual interaction tools as the alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text summarization techniques. We have applied our work to a number of text corpora and our evaluation shows the promise of the work, especially in support of complex text analyses.},

In addition to extracting topics, TIARA derives time-sensitive keywords to depict the content evolution of each topic over time. To help users understand the topic-based summarization results, TIARA employs several interactive text visualization techniques to explain the summarization results and seamlessly link such results to the original text. We have applied TIARA to several real-world applications, including email summarization and patient record analysis. To measure the effectiveness of TIARA, we have conducted several experiments. Our experimental results and initial user feedback suggest that TIARA is effective in aiding users in their exploratory text analytic tasks.},

In this paper, we provide the findings from an exploratory, three-year field study within a large automotive company, studying current practices of engineers, the challenges they meet and the characteristics for integrating novel visual analytics tools into their work practices. We then introduce Cardiogram, discuss how our field analysis influenced our design decisions, and present a qualitative, long-term, in-depth evaluation. Results of this study showed that our participants successfully used Cardiogram to increase the amount of analyzable information, to externalize domain knowledge, and to provide new insights into trace data.

Based on the Next Generation Teaching Education and Learning for Life (NEXT-TELL) European Commission integrated project, we envision classrooms of the 21st century to (a) incorporate 1:1 computing, (b) provide computational as well as methodological support for teachers to design, deploy and assess learning activities and (c) immerse students in rich, personalized and varied learning activities in information ecologies resulting in high-performance, high-density, high-bandwidth, and data-rich classrooms. In contrast to existing research in educational data mining and learning analytics, our vision is to employ visual analytics techniques and tools to support teachers dynamic diagnostic pedagogical decision-making in real-time and in actual classrooms. The primary benefits of our vision is that learning analytics becomes an integral part of the teaching profession so that teachers can provide timely, meaningful, and actionable formative assessments to on-going learning activities in-situ. Integrating emerging developments in visual analytics and the established methodological approach of design-based research (DBR) in the learning sciences, we introduce a new method called "Teaching Analytics" and explore a triadic model of teaching analytics (TMTA). TMTA adapts and extends the Pair Analytics method in visual analytics which in turn was inspired by the pair programming model of the extreme programming paradigm. Our preliminary vision of TMTA consists of a collocated collaborative triad of a Teaching Expert (TE), a Visual Analytics Expert (VAE), and a Design-Based Research Expert (DBRE) analyzing, interpreting and acting upon real-time data being generated by students' learning activities by using a range of visual analytics tools. We propose an implementation of TMTA using open learner models (OLM) and conclude with an outline of future work},

We propose a framework called COPA that provides a basis for mapping levels of cognitive operation into a learning analytics system. We utilise Bloom's taxonomy, a theoretically respected conceptualisation of cognitive processing, and apply it in a flexible structure that can be implemented incrementally and with varying degree of complexity within an educational organisation. We outline how the framework is applied, and its key benefits and limitations. Finally, we apply COPA to a University undergraduate unit, and demonstrate its utility in identifying key missing elements in the structure of the course.},

@book{mobus2014principles,
  abstract = {This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function, and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches to research on complex phenomena. While the concepts and components of systems science will continue to be distributed throughout the various disciplines, undergraduate degree programs in systems science are also being developed, including at the authors own institutions. However, the subject is approached, systems science as a basis for understanding the components and drivers of phenomena at all scales should be viewed with the same importance as a traditional liberal arts education.Principles of Systems Science contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective on the comprehensive nature of systems. It ends with practical aspects such as systems analysis, computer modeling, and systems engineering that demonstrate how the knowledge of systems can be used to solve problems in the real world. Each chapter is broken into parts beginning with qualitative descriptions that stand alone for students who have taken intermediate algebra. The second part presents quantitative descriptions that are based on pre-calculus and advanced algebra, providing a more formal treatment for students who have the necessary mathematical background. Numerous examples of systems from every realm of life, including the physical and biological sciences, humanities, social sciences, engineering, pre-med and pre-law, are based on the fundamental systems concepts of boundaries, components as subsystems, processes as flows of materials, energy, and messages, work accomplished, functions performed, hierarchical structures, and more. Understanding these basics enables further understanding both of how systems endure and how they may become increasingly complex and exhibit new properties or characteristics.Serves as a textbook for teaching systems fundamentals in any discipline or for use in an introductory course in systems science degree programsAddresses a wide range of audiences with different levels of mathematical sophisticationIncludes open-ended questions in special boxes intended to stimulate integrated thinking and class discussion Describes numerous examples of systems in science and societyCaptures the trend towards interdisciplinary research and problem solving.},

  description = {A thorough update to the industry standard for designing, developing, and deploying data warehouse and business intelligence systems

The world of data warehousing has changed remarkably since the first edition of The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit was published in 1998. In that time, the data warehouse industry has reached full maturity and acceptance, hardware and software have made staggering advances, and the techniques promoted in the premiere edition of this book have been adopted by nearly all data warehouse vendors and practitioners. In addition, the term "business intelligence" emerged to reflect the mission of the data warehouse: wrangling the data out of source systems, cleaning it, and delivering it to add value to the business.

Ralph Kimball and his colleagues have refined the original set of Lifecycle methods and techniques based on their consulting and training experience. The authors understand first-hand that a data warehousing/business intelligence (DW/BI) system needs to change as fast as its surrounding organization evolves. To that end, they walk you through the detailed steps of designing, developing, and deploying a DW/BI system. You'll learn to create adaptable systems that deliver data and analyses to business users so they can make better business decisions.

With substantial new and updated content, this second edition of The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit again sets the standard in data warehousing for the next decade. It shows you how to:

Identify and prioritize data warehouse opportunities
Create an architecture plan and select products
Design a powerful, flexible, dimensional model
Build a robust ETL system
Develop BI applications to deliver data to business users
Deploy and sustain a healthy DW/BI environment
The authors are members of the Kimball Group. Each has focused on data warehousing and business intelligence consulting and education for more than 15 years; most have written other books in the Toolkit series. Learn more about the Kimball Group and Kimball University at www.kimballgroup.com.},

With this information the reader can select both cloud vendors and the sometimes confusing cloud ecosystem as well as the R packages that can help process the analytical tasks with minimum effort and cost, and maximum usefulness and customization. The use of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and Step by Step screenshot tutorials is emphasized in this book to lessen the famous learning curve in learning R and some of the needless confusion created in cloud computing that hinders its widespread adoption. This will help you kick-start analytics on the cloud including chapters on cloud computing, R, common tasks performed in analytics, scrutiny of big data analytics, and setting up and navigating cloud providers. Readers are exposed to a breadth of cloud computing choices and analytics topics without being buried in needless depth. The included references and links allow the reader to pursue business analytics on the cloud easily. It is aimed at practical analytics and is easy to transition from existing analytical set up to the cloud on an open source system based primarily on R. This book is aimed at industry practitioners with basic programming skills and students who want to enter analytics as a profession. Note the scope of the book is neither statistical theory nor graduate level research for statistics, but rather it is for business analytics practitioners. It will also help researchers and academics but at a practical rather than conceptual level. The R statistical software is the fastest growing analytics platform in the world, and is established in both academia and corporations for robustness, reliability and accuracy. The cloud computing paradigm is firmly established as the next generation of computing from microprocessors to desktop PCs to cloud.},

Yet, bringing these levels together for an integrated visual exploration across levels poses a challenge up to this day. With this paper, we aim to provide a first solution approach to this challenge, which decomposes the data in its various levels to be able to show them side-by-side. Based on this decomposition, we derive a visual exploration approach that consists of a novel multilevel visualization, adjoined traditional spatial and temporal views, as well as of tailored exploration techniques for their concerted use. We exemplify the utility of this approach by case studies on election and poll data from Germany's various administrative levels and different time spans.},

Excerpt from the Introduction Haskell is fun, and thats what its all about! This book is aimed at people who have experience programming in imperative languagessuch as C++, Java, and Pythonand now want to try out Haskell. But even if you dont have any significant programming experience, Ill bet a smart person like you will be able to follow along and learn Haskell. My first reaction to Haskell was that the language was just too weird. But after getting over that initial hurdle, it was smooth sailing. Even if Haskell seems strange to you at first, dont give up. Learning Haskell is almost like learning to program for the first time all over again. Its fun, and it forces you to think differently. NOTE If you ever get really stuck, the IRC channel #haskell on the freenode network is a great place to ask questions. The people there tend to be nice, patient, and understanding. Theyre a great resource for Haskell newbies. So, What's Haskell? Haskell is a purely functional programming language. In imperative programming languages, you give the computer a sequence of tasks, which it then executes. While executing them, the computer can change state. For instance, you can set the variable a to 5 and then do some stuff that might change the value of a. There are also flow-control structures for executing instructions several times, such as for and while loops. Purely functional programming is different. You dont tell the computer what to doyou tell it what stuff is. For instance, you can tell the computer that the factorial of a number is the product of every integer from 1 to that number or that the sum of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of the remaining numbers. You can express both of these operations as functions. > Read the Introduction (PDF) in its entirety.},

  abstract = {Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features.

Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators.

You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar.

You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor.

Unfortunately, such analytic process is generally manual and fails to statistically explain results. In this work, we propose to combine dimension lattice traversal and parametric statistical tests to identify significant metric differences between cube cells. We present a 2D interactive visualization of the OLAP cube based on a checkerboard that enables isolating and interpreting significant measure differences between two similar cuboids, which differ in one dimension and have the same values on the remaining dimensions. Cube exploration and visualization is performed by automatically generated SQL queries. An experimental evaluation with a medical data set presents statistically significant results and interactive visualizations, which link risk factors and degree of disease.},

@book{armstrong2007programming,
  abstract = {Erlang solves one of the most pressing problems facing developers today: how to write reliable, concurrent, high-performance systems. It's used worldwide by companies who need to produce reliable, efficient, and scalable applications. Invest in learning Erlang now. Moore's Law is the observation that the amount you can do on a single chip doubles every two years. But Moore's Law is taking a detour. Rather than producing faster and faster processors, companies such as Intel and AMD are producing multi-core devices: single chips containing two, four, or more processors. If your programs aren't concurrent, they'll only run on a single processor at a time. Your users will think that your code is slow. Erlang is a programming language designed for building highly parallel, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. It has been used commercially for many years to build massive fault-tolerated systems that run for years with minimal failures. Erlang programs run seamlessly on multi-core computers: this means your Erlang program should run a lot faster on a 4 core processor than on a single core processor, all without you having to change a line of code. Erlang combines ideas from the world of functional programming with techniques for building fault-tolerant systems to make a powerful language for building the massively parallel, networked applications of the future. This book presents Erlang and functional programming in the familiar Pragmatic style. And it's written by Joe Armstrong, one of the creators of Erlang. It includes example code you'll be able to build upon. In addition, the book contains the full source code for two interesting applications:A SHOUTcast server which you can use to stream music to every computer in your house, and a full-text indexing and search engine that can index gigabytes of data. Learn how to write programs that run on dozens or even hundreds of local and remote processors. See how to write robust applications that run even in the face of network and hardware failure, using the Erlang programming language.},

Hume, systematically explores all the aspects of language central to second language learning: the sounds of language, the different grammatical structures, the social functions of communication, and the psychology of language learning and use.

	Unlike books specific to one single language, Basics of Language will help students of all languages. Readers will gain insight into the structure and use of their own language and will therefore see more clearly how the language they are learning differs from their first language. Language instructors will find the approach provocative, and the book will stimulate many new and effective ideas for teaching. Both a textbook and a reference work, Basics of Language will enhance the learning experience for anyone taking a foreign language course as well as the do-it-yourself learner.

	A new section, ``Tools and Strategies for Language Learning,'' has been added to this second edition. It comprises three chapters that focus on brain training, memory and using a dictionary. In addition, the section ``Thinking Like a Native Speaker'' has been substantially updated to include more discussion of errors made by language learners.},

Focusing on two-class pattern classification simplifies our discussion, and yet it is directly applicable to a wide range of practical settings.


We begin with a description of the two class pattern recognition problem. We then discuss various classical and state of the art approaches to this problem, with a focus on fundamental formulations, algorithms, and theoretical results.

A simple characterization of all wavelets is presented which is most useful for the construction of new families of wavelets. This technique can also be used for obtaining characterizations of low pass filters and scaling functions. Another feature is the use of wavelets for representing those function spaces that are most often encountered in analysis: the Lebesgue spaces, Hardy spaces, and more generally, the Besov spaces, the Sobolev, and the Lipschitz spaces. Other topics, some related to applications, are also included: the Fast Fourier Transform, wavelet packets, frames, local cosine and sine bases and their discrete versions are just some examples.},

Moreover, a textual analysis of a song can generate ground truth data that can be used to validate results from purely acoustic methods. Preliminary results on language identification, structure extraction, categorization and similarity searches suggests that a lot of profit can be gained from the analysis of lyrics.},

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, recognize faces or spoken speech, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. It discusses many methods based in different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining, in order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods. After an introduction that defines machine learning and gives examples of machine learning applications, the book covers supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, dimensionality reduction, clustering, nonparametric methods, decision trees, linear discrimination, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, combining multiple learners, and reinforcement learning.

Mitchell covers the field of machine learning, the study of algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience and that automatically infer general laws from specific data.},

@book{pinker1994language,
  abstract = {Everyone has questions about language. Some are from everyday experience: Why do immigrants struggle with a new language, only to have their fluent children ridicule their grammatical errors? Why can't computers converse with us? Why is the hockey team in Toronto called the Maple Leafs, not the Maple Leaves? Some are from popular science: Have scientists really reconstructed the first language spoken on earth? Are there genes for grammar? Can chimpanzees learn sign language? And some are from our deepest ponderings about the human condition: Does our language control our thoughts? How could language have evolved? Is language deteriorating? Today laypeople can chitchat about black holes and dinosaur extinictions, but their curiosity about their own speech has been left unsatisfied - until now. In The Language Instinct, Steven Pinker, one of the world's leading scientists of language and the mind, lucidly explains everything you always wanted to know about language: how it works, how children learn it, how it changes, how the brain computes it, how it evolved. But The Language Instinct is no encyclopedia. With wit, erudition, and deft use of everyday examples of humor and wordplay, Pinker weaves our vast knowledge of language into a compelling theory: that language is a human instinct, wired into our brains by evolution like web spinning in spiders or sonar in bats. The theory not only challenges conventional wisdom about language itself (especially from the self-appointed "experts" who claim to be safe-guarding the language but who understand it less well than a typical teenager). It is part of a whole new vision of the human mind: not a general-purpose computer, but a collection of instincts adapted to solving evolutionarily significant problems - the mind as a Swiss Army knife. Entertaining, insightful, provocative, The Language Instinct will change the way you talk about talking and think about thinking.},

This review examines probabilistic models defined over traditional symbolic structures. Language comprehension and production involve probabilistic inference in such models; and acquisition involves choosing the best model, given innate constraints and linguistic and other input. Probabilistic models can account for the learning and processing of language, while maintaining the sophistication of symbolic models. A recent burgeoning of theoretical developments and online corpus creation has enabled large models to be tested, revealing probabilistic constraints in processing, undermining acquisition arguments based on a perceived poverty of the stimulus, and suggesting fruitful links with probabilistic theories of categorization and ambiguity resolution in perception.},

This position paper argues that there is a habitability gap caused by the inevitable mismatch between the capabilities and expectations of human users and the features and benefits provided by contemporary technology. Suggestions are made as to how such problems might be mitigated, but a more worrisome question emerges: "is spoken language all-or-nothing"? The answer, based on contemporary views on the special nature of (spoken) language, is that there may indeed be a fundamental limit to the interaction that can take place between mismatched interlocutors (such as humans and machines). However, it is concluded that interactions between native and non-native speakers, or between adults and children, or even between humans and dogs, might provide critical inspiration for the design of future speech-based human-machine interaction.},

Since then, we have seen several notable corpora that are about 100 times larger, and in 2006, Google released a trillion-word corpus with frequency counts for all sequences up to five words long. In some ways this corpus is a step backwards from the Brown Corpus: it's taken from unfiltered Web pages and thus contains incomplete sentences, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and all sorts of other errors. It's not annotated with carefully hand-corrected part-of-speech tags. But the fact that it's a million times larger than the Brown Corpus outweighs these drawbacks. A trillion-word corpus - along with other Web-derived corpora of millions, billions, or trillions of links, videos, images, tables, and user interactions - captures even very rare aspects of human behavior. So, this corpus could serve as the basis of a complete model for certain tasks - if only we knew how to extract the model from the data.},

@misc{donoho2015years,
  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ‚ÄúThe Future of Data Analysis,‚Äù he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ‚Äúdata analysis.‚Äù Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ‚Äúdata science‚Äù for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ‚Äúdata science‚Äù programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M ‚ÄúData Science Initiative‚Äù that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ‚Äúcultural appropriation.‚Äù This article reviews some ingredients of the current ‚Äúdata science moment,‚Äù including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ‚Äúscaling up‚Äù to ‚Äúbig data.‚Äù This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ‚Äúscaling up,‚Äù but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ‚Äúlearning from data,‚Äù and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today‚Äôs data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.},

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data.
This book is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining.
All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning.},

Usually this means that ontology describes concepts and relations that exist in a domain. To enable knowledge exchange, it is necessary to describe these concepts and relations in a better way than just ordering them in taxonomy. However, ontology design usually starts and stops with designing taxonomies. We present a method that is based on formal concept analysis, which is a theory of data analysis which identifies conceptual structures among data sets. This method allows for discovering necessity for new concepts and relations in an ontology, which leads to an ontology that has these entities described in a way suitable for knowledge exchange.},

@book{martin2009clean,
  abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code 'on the fly' into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer-but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code-lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code-of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and 'smells' gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Freund and Schapire[1996]), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

This lighthearted (but realistic) sneak-peak into the everyday world of mathematicians turns that stereotype on its head. Most people have little idea what mathematicians do or how they think. It's often difficult to see how their seemingly arcane and esoteric work applies to our own everyday lives. But mathematics also holds a special allure for many people. We are drawn to its inherent beauty and fascinated by its complexity - but often intimidated by its presumed difficulty. "The Secret Life of Numbers" opens our eyes to the joys of mathematics, introducing us to the charming, often whimsical side, of the discipline. Divided into several parts, the book looks at interesting and largely unknown historical tidbits, introduces the larger than - life practitioners of mathematics through the ages, profiles some of the most significant unsolved conjectures, and describes problems and puzzles that have already been solved. Rounding out the table of contents is a host of mathematical miscellany - all of which add up to 50 fun, sometimes cheeky, short takes on the field. Chock full of stories, anecdotes, and entertaining vignettes, "The Secret Life of Numbers" shows us how mathematics really does affect almost every aspect of life - from the law to geography, elections to botany - and we come to appreciate the delight and gratification that mathematics holds for all of us.},

@book{pinker2015words,
  abstract = {How does language work? How do children learn their mother tongue? Why do languages change over time, making Shakespearean English difficult for us and Chaucer‚Äôs English almost incomprehensible? Why do languages have so many quirks and irregularities? Are they all fundamentally alike? How are new words created? Where in the brain does language reside?

In Words and Rules, Steven Pinker answers these and many other questions. His book shares the wit and style of his classic, The Language Instinct, but explores language in a completely different way. In Words and Rules, Pinker explains the profound mysteries of language by picking a deceptively simple phenomenon and examining it from every angle. The phenomenon‚Äîregular and irregular verbs‚Äîconnects an astonishing array of topics in the sciences and humanities: the history of languages, the theories of Noam Chomsky and his critics; the attempts to simulate language using computer simulations of neural networks; the illuminating errors of children as they begin to speak; the nature of human concepts; the peculiarities of the English language; major ideas in the history of Western philosophy; the latest techniques in identifying genes and imaging the living brain.

Pinker makes sense of all of this with the help of a single, powerful idea: that language comprises a mental dictionary of memorized words and a mental grammar of creative rules. The idea extends beyond language and offers insight into the very nature of the human mind. This is a sparkling, eye-opening and utterly original book by one of the world‚Äôs leading cognitive scientists.},

@book{subramuniyaswami1999merging,
  abstract = {Spirituality in the New Age has tended to reflect our technological obsessions. It is, usually, verbose, complicated and complex. The problem with this approach is that it works with the mind, even perhaps the emotions, but does not speak to the essential self. So much modern spiritual literature works to compete in the world with secular and mainstream writing, hence rather than really reaching us it simply presents another theory, another technique, a new form of yoga or meditation. This penchant for novelty may fill a consumer need, but does not necessarily feed the soul.
"Merging with Siva" is a very different sort of book. Its heart is comprised of 365 short sections which can be read in a year, spending around 10 minutes a day. Each section is very easy to read, simple and written in a direct style. It is only throughout the next day as you think over what you have read that you begin to realize the strength of each message. "Merging with Siva" embodies the concept that there is immense power in simplicity. Each section while flowing effortlessly seems to bypass emotions, intellect and body and touch something much deeper. While it may only take 10 minutes to read, one wonders if there is not a lifetime of meaning condensed into each passage. Condensing and distilling--each of these words describe "Merging with Siva." It is as though through a unique alchemical process the secrets of life have been condensed into simple but poignant and powerful expressions. The beauty of teaching in bite sized packages is the way in which quite complex subjects can be slowly unveiled.

"Merging with Siva" is like building a house, each brick is placed onto another until the whole edifice is revealed. This allows us to contemplate individual concepts which interconnect as the whole picture is unveiled. Accordingly, difficult and complex matters are taught with an ease which would make many school teachers jealous!

I personally find the Self God, which is included at the start of the book very meaningful. I first came across it many, many years ago in a small booklet I found at a second hand store. It was an ecstatic experience as I read what seemed to be like nectar, juice squeezed from the fruit of spiritual experience. This one booklet led me on a journey that culminated in my personal contact with the Himalayan Academy. It is included at the start of "Merging with Siva," printed in the handwriting of Subramuniyaswami. At first this seems annoying, even a nuisance. It cannot be quickly read or glossed over. Here, then, is the importance and power of the text. As you work to read each work, phrase and paragraph its message and vision begins to unfold. It is a great way to begin your journey through Merging with Siva.

There is so much more in this book that it is hard to summarize. There is, of course, good solid background information on the tradition of Saiva Siddhanta: its theology and practise and certainly more than enough to provide one of the better introductions to Shaivism as a living spiritual tradition. But what makes Merging with Siva so unique is its ability to bring that living tradition within reach of the seeker. It slowly draws the reader into a deep understanding of themselves, the universe and the great "spiritual chain of being" of which we are part. It does so simply, succinctly and yet with great erudition and wisdom.

Merging with Siva is a modest text. There is no new age hype, no outrageous claims, no UFO abductions nor calls to the bizarre or garish. There is a simple and honest presentation of the distilled wisdom of a lifetime and this makes Merging with Siva very rare and quite unique. In my personal collection I consider it one of the most important books I have. Its presentation matches its content. Superb. It is beautifully illustrated, easy on the eye and professionally presented. I commend Merging with Siva to you.},

In the worst case, bad usage of these constructs might lead to errors, to ineffective queries, or hamper developers in their tasks. This paper presents a mining technique for Stack Overflow to identify error-prone patterns in SQL queries. Identifying such patterns can help developers to avoid the use of error-prone constructs, or if they have to use such constructs, the Stack Overflow posts can help them to properly utilize the language. Hence, our purpose is to provide the initial steps towards a recommendation system that supports developers in constructing SQL queries. Our current implementation supports the MySQL dialect, and Stack Overflow has over 300,000 questions tagged with the MySQL flag in its database. It provides a huge knowledge base where developers can ask questions about real problems. Our initial results indicate that our technique is indeed able to identify patterns among them.},

@article{fodor1988connectionism,
  abstract = {This paper explores differences between Connectionist proposals for cognitive architecture and the sorts of models that have traditionally been assumed in cognitive science. We claim that the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and Classical architectures postulate representational mental states, the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of representation, or to a ‚Äòlanguage of thought‚Äô: i.e., to representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the ‚Äòsystematicity‚Äô of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or ‚Äòabstract neurological‚Äô) structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation. },

@article{finch2012distribution,
  abstract = {Abstract
	The presence of outliers can very problematic in data analysis, leading statisticians to develop a wide variety of methods for identifying them in both the univariate and multivariate contexts.  In case of the latter, perhaps the most popular approach has been Mahalanobis distance, where large values suggest an observation that is unusual as compared to the center of the data.  However, researchers have identified problems with the application of this metric such that its utility may be limited in some situations.  As a consequence, other methods for detecting outlying observations have been developed and studied.  However, a number of these approaches, while apparently robust and useful have not made their way into general practice in the social sciences.  Thus, the goal of this study was to describe some of these methods and demonstrate them using a well known dataset from a popular multivariate textbook widely used in the social sciences.  Results demonstrated that the methods do indeed result in datasets with very different distributional characteristics.  These results are discussed in light of how they might be used by researchers and practitioners.

Outlier Analysis is a comprehensive exposition, as understood by data mining experts, statisticians and computer scientists. The book has been organized carefully, and emphasis was placed on simplifying the content, so that students and practitioners can also benefit. Chapters will typically cover one of three areas: methods and techniques  commonly used in outlier analysis, such as linear methods, proximity-based methods, subspace methods, and supervised methods; data  domains, such as, text, categorical, mixed-attribute, time-series, streaming, discrete sequence, spatial and network data; and key applications of these methods as applied to diverse domains such as  credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, earth science, web log analytics, and social network analysis are covered.},

@article{wilcox2012modern,
  abstract = {During the last half century, hundreds of papers published in statistical journals have documented general conditions where reliance on least squares regression and Pearson's correlation can result in missing even strong associations between variables. Moreover, highly misleading conclusions can be made, even when the sample size is large. There are, in fact, several fundamental concerns related to non-normality, outliers, heteroscedasticity, and curvature that can result in missing a strong association. Simultaneously, a vast array of new methods has been derived for effectively dealing with these concerns. The paper (i) reviews why least squares regression and classic inferential methods can fail, (ii) provides an overview of the many modern strategies for dealing with known problems, including some recent advances, and (iii) illustrates that modern robust methods can make a practical difference in our understanding of data. Included are some general recommendations regarding how modern methods might be used. Copyright ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Description

Introduction to Robust Estimating and Hypothesis Testing, 4th Editon, is a ‚Äòhow-to‚Äô on the application of robust methods using available software. Modern robust methods provide improved techniques for dealing with outliers, skewed distribution curvature and heteroscedasticity that can provide substantial gains in power as well as a deeper, more accurate and more nuanced understanding of data. Since the last edition, there have been numerous advances and improvements. They include new techniques for comparing groups and measuring effect size as well as new methods for comparing quantiles. Many new regression methods have been added that include both parametric and nonparametric techniques. The methods related to ANCOVA have been expanded considerably. New perspectives related to discrete distributions with a relatively small sample space are described as well as new results relevant to the shift function. The practical importance of these methods is illustrated using data from real world studies. The R package written for this book now contains over 1200 functions.
